# Caloric Restriction Mimetics in 2025: Multi-Pathway Geroprotectors Under Clinical Evaluation

A 2025 review in *Biogerontology* maps the current landscape of caloric restriction (CR) mimetics — compounds that activate biological pathways associated with longevity without requiring actual food restriction. The review identifies five recurring domains in the geroprotective pipeline: nutrient-sensing (mTOR, AMPK), mitochondrial resilience, inflammation control, autophagy induction, and senescent cell clearance. Most compounds have mechanistic and animal-model support; human evidence is limited to biomarker endpoints, not hard longevity or disease outcomes.

## What Are Caloric Restriction Mimetics?

Caloric restriction extends lifespan in multiple model organisms by activating conserved energy-sensing pathways. When calories are restricted, AMPK is activated (sensing low energy), mTOR is suppressed (reducing anabolic signaling), and autophagy increases (clearing cellular debris). CR mimetics attempt to engage these pathways pharmacologically or nutraceutically, without the practical challenges of sustained caloric restriction.

## Key Compounds and Evidence Grades

**Rapamycin (mTOR inhibitor):** The most studied geroprotective drug in animals. Lifespan extension has been demonstrated in mice even when started in late life. Human data is limited to transplant doses (immunosuppressive) and small off-label trials. The PEARL trial (NCT04488601) showed no improvement in the primary endpoint (visceral fat) at low weekly doses. Risk of immunosuppression, metabolic side effects, and drug interactions makes this unsuitable for unsupervised use.

**Berberine (AMPK activator):** Plant alkaloid with human RCT data for glucose and lipid lowering. Acts as an AMPK activator and mild mTOR suppressor. Evidence is strongest for metabolic endpoints (HbA1c, LDL) in adults with type 2 diabetes or metabolic syndrome; extrapolation to longevity endpoints is preclinical.

**Metformin (AMPK activator):** Biguanide diabetes drug with the largest observational longevity signal in humans (diabetics on metformin outliving non-diabetic controls in some cohorts). The TAME trial (NCT03781453) is ongoing — the first prospective trial powered for multi-morbidity as a primary endpoint. Results are not yet available.

**Spermidine (autophagy inducer):** Dietary polyamine found in wheat germ and aged cheese. Eisenberg et al. 2016 (*Nature Medicine*) showed cardiovascular mortality reduction in cohort data. The POLYCAD trial (n=187, coronary artery disease, 24 mg/day, 48 weeks) is testing this prospectively — completion expected August 2026.

**NMN/NR (NAD+ precursors):** Reliably increase blood NAD+ in humans. Whether elevated NAD+ extends healthspan in healthy adults at meaningful effect sizes is unresolved. The primary mechanistic benefit works via sirtuin activation and mitochondrial biogenesis.

## Why Multi-Pathway Approaches Are Gaining Interest

Single-target compounds often underdeliver because aging is driven by overlapping, interacting hallmarks. The 2025 review argues that combination protocols layering interventions across nutrient-sensing, mitochondrial, and inflammatory pathways may produce more robust effects than any individual compound. This logic is scientifically compelling but currently untested in human trials with hard endpoints.

## What Remains Uncertain

Most CR mimetic human trials measure biomarker endpoints (blood NAD+, inflammatory markers) rather than clinical outcomes (hospitalization, disease incidence, mortality). Whether biomarker improvements translate to meaningful healthspan extension is not established. Long-term safety of stacked geroprotective protocols, interaction effects in polypharmacy contexts, and which subgroups benefit most are all unresolved. The review acknowledges that extrapolating from model organisms to humans has historically been unreliable.

## Practical Interpretation

For most adults, established lifestyle interventions — resistance and aerobic exercise, sleep consistency, blood pressure and glucose control — remain the strongest longevity tools with the best evidence base. CR mimetics are best viewed as potential amplifiers of a disciplined foundation. Conservative add-ons (berberine for metabolic dysfunction, spermidine as a dietary polyamine) carry lower risk profiles than pharmacological options (rapamycin, metformin) which require medical supervision.
