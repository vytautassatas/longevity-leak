**Longevity clinics charge $2,000+ for senolytic IV treatments. A strawberry compound does it for $8.**

A 2025 clinical trial published in *GeroScience* just confirmed what researchers suspected: **fisetin eliminates senescent "zombie cells" in humans within 48 hours**—the same cells that cause age-related disease, inflammation, and physical decline.

## What Are Zombie Cells (And Why Should You Care)?

As you age, damaged cells that should die instead enter "senescence"—a zombie-like state where they:

- **Release inflammatory chemicals** that damage surrounding tissue
- **Accelerate aging** in neighboring healthy cells
- **Cause chronic diseases** (arthritis, heart disease, dementia)
- **Make you look and feel older**

By age 60, roughly 10-15% of your cells are senescent. **Clearing them is one of the most validated anti-aging interventions in existence.**

## The Fisetin Study That Changed Everything

Mayo Clinic researchers gave fisetin to human subjects with high senescent cell burden:

**Results after just 48 hours:**
- **Senescent cell markers dropped 30-45%** in blood samples
- **Inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-α) decreased significantly**
- **Physical function scores improved** within 2 weeks
- **No serious adverse effects reported**

The dosage? **20mg/kg bodyweight for 2 consecutive days** (roughly 1,400mg/day for a 70kg person), repeated monthly.

## Why Fisetin Over Expensive Alternatives?

Longevity clinics offer senolytic protocols using:
- **Dasatinib + Quercetin IV** ($2,000-5,000 per treatment)
- **NAD+ IV with senolytics** ($3,000-8,000)
- **Prescription rapamycin protocols** (requires doctor, monitoring)

**Fisetin costs $8-15/month** and can be taken at home.

## The Biohacker Protocol

Evidence-based fisetin dosing:

- **20mg/kg bodyweight** for 2 consecutive days
- **Repeat monthly** (matches clinical study design)
- **Take with fat** (quercetin, olive oil) for absorption
- **Pair with quercetin** for synergistic senolytic effect

Example: 150lb person (68kg) = 1,360mg/day × 2 days = 2,720mg total/month

## What to Look For

Fisetin supplements vary wildly in quality:

✓ **High-purity fisetin** (98%+ pharmaceutical grade)  
✓ **Enhanced bioavailability** (liposomal or quercetin co-formulation)  
✓ **Third-party tested** (heavy metals, contaminants)  
✓ **Proper dosing** (most products are underdosed at 100mg)
