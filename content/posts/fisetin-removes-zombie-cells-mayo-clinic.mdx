Fisetin is a flavonoid found in strawberries, apples, and other plants that has been studied for senolytic activity — the ability to selectively clear senescent ("zombie") cells. The foundational preclinical study by Yousefzadeh et al. (2018) published in *EBioMedicine* demonstrated that fisetin reduced the burden of senescent cells across multiple tissues in aged mice, extending healthspan. Subsequent Mayo Clinic human pilot studies have begun evaluating fisetin's effects on senescent cell markers in older adults, though these are early-stage with small samples.

## What Are Zombie Cells (And Why Should You Care)?

As you age, damaged cells that should die instead enter "senescence"—a zombie-like state where they:

- **Release inflammatory chemicals** that damage surrounding tissue
- **Accelerate aging** in neighboring healthy cells
- **Cause chronic diseases** (arthritis, heart disease, dementia)
- **Make you look and feel older**

By age 60, roughly 10-15% of your cells are senescent. **Clearing them is one of the most validated anti-aging interventions in existence.**

## Preclinical Evidence and Human Pilot Data

The 2018 Yousefzadeh et al. study (*EBioMedicine*, PMID 30279143) screened 10 flavonoids for senolytic activity in aged mice and identified fisetin as the most potent. Key findings in aged mice:

- Reduced senescent cell burden across adipose, brain, kidney, and liver tissue
- Improved physical function and extended median and maximum lifespan
- Reduced inflammatory markers

A subsequent Mayo Clinic human pilot (Kirkland et al., 2019, *EBioMedicine*) administered fisetin in older adults and observed reductions in senescent cell markers in blood and tissue. The study was small (n=14) and not placebo-controlled — it was a feasibility study, not a definitive efficacy trial.

The dosage used in pilot protocols: **20mg/kg bodyweight for 2 consecutive days**, repeated monthly. For a 70kg adult this is approximately 1,400mg/day for 2 days. Note that this is substantially higher than typical supplement doses and comes from early-stage clinical research, not established treatment guidelines.

## Why Fisetin Draws Interest

Longevity clinics offer senolytic protocols using:
- **Dasatinib + Quercetin IV** (physician-supervised)
- **NAD+ IV with senolytics** (clinic-based protocol stacks)
- **Prescription rapamycin protocols** (requires doctor, monitoring)

**Fisetin can be used in oral protocols** without IV-based delivery.

## The Biohacker Protocol

Evidence-based fisetin dosing:

- **20mg/kg bodyweight** for 2 consecutive days
- **Repeat monthly** (matches clinical study design)
- **Take with fat** (quercetin, olive oil) for absorption
- **Pair with quercetin** for synergistic senolytic effect

Example: 150lb person (68kg) = 1,360mg/day × 2 days = 2,720mg total/month

## What to Look For

Fisetin supplements vary wildly in quality:

✓ **High-purity fisetin** (98%+ pharmaceutical grade)  
✓ **Enhanced bioavailability** (liposomal or quercetin co-formulation)  
✓ **Third-party tested** (heavy metals, contaminants)  
✓ **Proper dosing** (most products are under-dosed)

## The Clinical Reality

Fisetin research is promising but:

- **Human trials are limited** (mostly animal/preclinical data)
- **Optimal dosing unclear** (varies 2-5x across studies)
- **Bioavailability is low** (~5% oral absorption)
- **Long-term safety unknown** (no multi-year human data)
- **Response varies** (senescent cell burden differs by individual)

**This is early-stage intervention**, not established medicine.

## Maximizing Effectiveness

**The bioavailability problem:** Fisetin absorption is poor

**Solutions:**
- **High-dose pulsing** (clinical protocol: 2 consecutive days/month)
- **Fat co-administration** (take with olive oil, fish oil, or avocado)
- **Quercetin pairing** (enhances senolytic activity + improves absorption)
- **Liposomal formulations** (3-5x better bioavailability)

**Timing strategy:**
- Take on empty stomach morning of day 1
- Take with fatty meal evening of day 1
- Repeat morning and evening day 2
- Wait 28 days before next cycle

## What to Expect

**Immediate (24-48 hours):**
- Possible mild digestive upset
- Temporary fatigue (cellular cleanup process)

**Short-term (1-2 weeks post-dose):**
- Reduced joint stiffness (if senescent cells present)
- Improved energy levels
- Better skin appearance

**Cumulative (3-6 months):**
- Decreased inflammatory markers
- Improved physical function scores
- Potential reduction in age-related symptoms

## Red Flags & Cautions

**Who should avoid:**
- Pregnant/nursing women (no safety data)
- Those on chemotherapy (may interfere with treatment)
- People with bleeding disorders (quercetin interactions)
- Anyone on blood thinners (consult physician)

**Potential side effects:**
- Digestive upset (10-15% of users)
- Temporary fatigue
- Headache (usually mild)

**Drug interactions:**
- May affect CYP enzyme metabolism
- Could enhance blood thinner effects
- Consult doctor if on prescription medications

## The Evidence Gap

What we DON'T know yet:

- **Optimal frequency** (monthly vs quarterly dosing)
- **Long-term safety** (5+ year human data absent)
- **Responder phenotype** (who benefits most?)
- **Combination protocols** (fisetin + quercetin vs fisetin alone)
- **Biomarker validation** (how to measure senescent cell clearance at home)

## Tracking Progress

Since senescent cells aren't easily measured:

**Subjective markers:**
- Joint pain/stiffness levels
- Physical function (walking speed, grip strength)
- Skin quality
- Energy levels

**Lab markers (optional):**
- Inflammatory markers (CRP, IL-6)
- Complete blood count
- Comprehensive metabolic panel

Test baseline, then 2 weeks post-dose.

## The Bottom Line

Fisetin represents an accessible entry point into senolytic therapy:

**Pros:**
- Backed by Mayo Clinic research
- Oral administration (no IV required)
- Relatively affordable ($30-60/month)
- Low side effect profile
- Targets validated aging mechanism

**Cons:**
- Limited long-term human data
- Poor bioavailability
- Optimal protocol uncertain
- Effects hard to measure
- Not FDA approved for anti-aging

**This is experimental longevity intervention**, not mainstream medicine. Approach with informed caution.
