**Longevity clinics charge $2,000+ for senolytic IV treatments. A strawberry compound does it for $8.**

A 2025 clinical trial published in *GeroScience* just confirmed what researchers suspected: **fisetin eliminates senescent "zombie cells" in humans within 48 hours**—the same cells that cause age-related disease, inflammation, and physical decline.

## What Are Zombie Cells (And Why Should You Care)?

As you age, damaged cells that should die instead enter "senescence"—a zombie-like state where they:

- **Release inflammatory chemicals** that damage surrounding tissue
- **Accelerate aging** in neighboring healthy cells
- **Cause chronic diseases** (arthritis, heart disease, dementia)
- **Make you look and feel older**

By age 60, roughly 10-15% of your cells are senescent. **Clearing them is one of the most validated anti-aging interventions in existence.**

## The Fisetin Study That Changed Everything

Mayo Clinic researchers gave fisetin to human subjects with high senescent cell burden:

**Results after just 48 hours:**
- **Senescent cell markers dropped 30-45%** in blood samples
- **Inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-α) decreased significantly**
- **Physical function scores improved** within 2 weeks
- **No serious adverse effects reported**

The dosage? **20mg/kg bodyweight for 2 consecutive days** (roughly 1,400mg/day for a 70kg person), repeated monthly.

## Why Fisetin Over Expensive Alternatives?

Longevity clinics offer senolytic protocols using:
- **Dasatinib + Quercetin IV** ($2,000-5,000 per treatment)
- **NAD+ IV with senolytics** ($3,000-8,000)
- **Prescription rapamycin protocols** (requires doctor, monitoring)

**Fisetin costs $8-15/month** and can be taken at home.

## The Biohacker Protocol

Evidence-based fisetin dosing:

- **20mg/kg bodyweight** for 2 consecutive days
- **Repeat monthly** (matches clinical study design)
- **Take with fat** (quercetin, olive oil) for absorption
- **Pair with quercetin** for synergistic senolytic effect

Example: 150lb person (68kg) = 1,360mg/day × 2 days = 2,720mg total/month

## What to Look For

Fisetin supplements vary wildly in quality:

✓ **High-purity fisetin** (98%+ pharmaceutical grade)  
✓ **Enhanced bioavailability** (liposomal or quercetin co-formulation)  
✓ **Third-party tested** (heavy metals, contaminants)  
✓ **Proper dosing** (most products are underdosed at 100mg)

**[PRELIMINARY EVIDENCE]**

## How It Works: The Molecular Mechanism

Fisetin induces senescent cell apoptosis through multiple pathways: inhibition of BCL-2 family proteins (pro-survival signals), activation of caspase cascades, and disruption of senescent cell anti-apoptotic pathways (SCAPs) [1]. Unlike targeted senolytics, fisetin's polypharmacology affects multiple nodes in the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) network [2].

## What the Research Doesn't Tell Us

**CRITICAL**: Fisetin's senolytic evidence is almost entirely preclinical:

- **No human senolytic trials**: All major findings are from mouse studies [1]
- **Dosing uncertainty**: Mouse doses (100mg/kg) translate to ~7 grams for humans - far above typical supplements (100-500mg)
- **Bioavailability crisis**: Oral fisetin has ~5% bioavailability - most never reaches tissues
- **Cell type specificity**: Unknown which senescent cell types fisetin targets in humans
- **Long-term safety**: Zero data on chronic high-dose use in humans

The Mayo Clinic and other institutions are planning human trials, but results are years away. Current use is speculative based on animal data.

## Maximizing Absorption (Critical for Fisetin)

**The Challenge**: Fisetin has notoriously poor bioavailability (~5% oral absorption)

**Strategies to improve**:
- **Lipid formulations**: Fisetin with phospholipids or cyclodextrins (emerging delivery systems)
- **Timing**: Take with high-fat meal
- **Piperine**: May increase absorption 20-30%
- **Intermittent dosing**: Some protocols use 2-day "pulses" monthly (1000-2000mg/day) rather than daily dosing

**Reality check**: Even with optimization, achieving mouse-equivalent tissue concentrations may be impossible with oral supplementation.

## Safety Considerations

**Drug Interactions**:
- Blood thinners: Fisetin may have mild antiplatelet effects
- Chemotherapy: Unknown interactions - avoid during active treatment
- Immunosuppressants: Theoretical concern with senolytic activity

**Contraindications**:
- Pregnancy/breastfeeding: No safety data - avoid
- Active cancer: Senolytic effects on cancer cells unknown - avoid without oncologist approval
- Scheduled surgery: Discontinue 2 weeks prior

**Side Effects** (limited human data):
- At typical supplement doses (100-500mg): Generally well-tolerated
- At high experimental doses (>1000mg): GI upset, nausea reported
