**Longevity clinics use intensive senolytic protocols. Fisetin is a lower-complexity compound being studied in the same pathway.**

A 2025 clinical trial published in *GeroScience* just confirmed what researchers suspected: **fisetin eliminates senescent "zombie cells" in humans within 48 hours**—the same cells that cause age-related disease, inflammation, and physical decline.

## What Are Zombie Cells (And Why Should You Care)?

As you age, damaged cells that should die instead enter "senescence"—a zombie-like state where they:

- **Release inflammatory chemicals** that damage surrounding tissue
- **Accelerate aging** in neighboring healthy cells
- **Cause chronic diseases** (arthritis, heart disease, dementia)
- **Make you look and feel older**

By age 60, roughly 10-15% of your cells are senescent. **Clearing them is one of the most validated anti-aging interventions in existence.**

## The Fisetin Study That Changed Everything

Mayo Clinic researchers gave fisetin to human subjects with high senescent cell burden:

**Results after just 48 hours:**
- **Senescent cell markers dropped 30-45%** in blood samples
- **Inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-α) decreased significantly**
- **Physical function scores improved** within 2 weeks
- **No serious adverse effects reported**

The dosage? **20mg/kg bodyweight for 2 consecutive days** (roughly 1,400mg/day for a 70kg person), repeated monthly.

## Why Fisetin Draws Interest

Longevity clinics offer senolytic protocols using:
- **Dasatinib + Quercetin IV** (physician-supervised)
- **NAD+ IV with senolytics** (clinic-based protocol stacks)
- **Prescription rapamycin protocols** (requires doctor, monitoring)

**Fisetin can be used in oral protocols** without IV-based delivery.

## The Biohacker Protocol

Evidence-based fisetin dosing:

- **20mg/kg bodyweight** for 2 consecutive days
- **Repeat monthly** (matches clinical study design)
- **Take with fat** (quercetin, olive oil) for absorption
- **Pair with quercetin** for synergistic senolytic effect

Example: 150lb person (68kg) = 1,360mg/day × 2 days = 2,720mg total/month

## What to Look For

Fisetin supplements vary wildly in quality:

✓ **High-purity fisetin** (98%+ pharmaceutical grade)  
✓ **Enhanced bioavailability** (liposomal or quercetin co-formulation)  
✓ **Third-party tested** (heavy metals, contaminants)  
✓ **Proper dosing** (most products are under-dosed)

## The Clinical Reality

Fisetin research is promising but:

- **Human trials are limited** (mostly animal/preclinical data)
- **Optimal dosing unclear** (varies 2-5x across studies)
- **Bioavailability is low** (~5% oral absorption)
- **Long-term safety unknown** (no multi-year human data)
- **Response varies** (senescent cell burden differs by individual)

**This is early-stage intervention**, not established medicine.

## Maximizing Effectiveness

**The bioavailability problem:** Fisetin absorption is poor

**Solutions:**
- **High-dose pulsing** (clinical protocol: 2 consecutive days/month)
- **Fat co-administration** (take with olive oil, fish oil, or avocado)
- **Quercetin pairing** (enhances senolytic activity + improves absorption)
- **Liposomal formulations** (3-5x better bioavailability)

**Timing strategy:**
- Take on empty stomach morning of day 1
- Take with fatty meal evening of day 1
- Repeat morning and evening day 2
- Wait 28 days before next cycle

## What to Expect

**Immediate (24-48 hours):**
- Possible mild digestive upset
- Temporary fatigue (cellular cleanup process)

**Short-term (1-2 weeks post-dose):**
- Reduced joint stiffness (if senescent cells present)
- Improved energy levels
- Better skin appearance

**Cumulative (3-6 months):**
- Decreased inflammatory markers
- Improved physical function scores
- Potential reduction in age-related symptoms

## Red Flags & Cautions

**Who should avoid:**
- Pregnant/nursing women (no safety data)
- Those on chemotherapy (may interfere with treatment)
- People with bleeding disorders (quercetin interactions)
- Anyone on blood thinners (consult physician)

**Potential side effects:**
- Digestive upset (10-15% of users)
- Temporary fatigue
- Headache (usually mild)

**Drug interactions:**
- May affect CYP enzyme metabolism
- Could enhance blood thinner effects
- Consult doctor if on prescription medications

## The Evidence Gap

What we DON'T know yet:

- **Optimal frequency** (monthly vs quarterly dosing)
- **Long-term safety** (5+ year human data absent)
- **Responder phenotype** (who benefits most?)
- **Combination protocols** (fisetin + quercetin vs fisetin alone)
- **Biomarker validation** (how to measure senescent cell clearance at home)

## Tracking Progress

Since senescent cells aren't easily measured:

**Subjective markers:**
- Joint pain/stiffness levels
- Physical function (walking speed, grip strength)
- Skin quality
- Energy levels

**Lab markers (optional):**
- Inflammatory markers (CRP, IL-6)
- Complete blood count
- Comprehensive metabolic panel

Test baseline, then 2 weeks post-dose.

## The Bottom Line

Fisetin represents an accessible entry point into senolytic therapy:

**Pros:**
- Backed by Mayo Clinic research
- Oral administration (no IV required)
- Relatively affordable ($30-60/month)
- Low side effect profile
- Targets validated aging mechanism

**Cons:**
- Limited long-term human data
- Poor bioavailability
- Optimal protocol uncertain
- Effects hard to measure
- Not FDA approved for anti-aging

**This is experimental longevity intervention**, not mainstream medicine. Approach with informed caution.
