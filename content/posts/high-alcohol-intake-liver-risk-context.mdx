# High Alcohol Intake Risk: Liver and Recovery Context for NAC, Silymarin, and B12

For [High Alcohol Intake Risk](/conditions/high-alcohol-intake-risk), reduction in weekly alcohol exposure is the dominant treatment. Supplement strategies should not be framed as a substitute for intake change.

## Adjuncts in selected settings

- [N-Acetylcysteine (NAC)](/supplements/n-acetylcysteine) may support oxidative-stress pathways.
- [Milk Thistle (Silymarin)](/supplements/milk-thistle-silymarin) can provide modest liver-enzyme support in some contexts.
- [Vitamin B12](/supplements/vitamin-b12) may be relevant where alcohol-related intake/absorption patterns raise deficiency risk.

## Practical protocol context

The foundation remains:
1. Intake reduction plan with social-trigger strategy.
2. Sleep and recovery restoration.
3. Lab monitoring when indicated (liver enzymes, nutrient status).

For overlapping hepatic risk, see [Liver Enzyme Elevation Risk](/conditions/liver-enzyme-elevation-risk).

## Limits and risk framing

These adjuncts do not neutralize chronic high alcohol exposure. Overconfidence in supplement protection can delay the core intervention and increase long-term risk.

## Practical summary

- Intake reduction is non-negotiable.
- Adjuncts may help selected biochemical contexts.
- Monitoring and clinical review remain essential.
