# Women Build Muscle on 10mg Weekly Rapamycin (Men Need Double the Dose)

## What the PEARL Trial Signal Suggests

The PEARL data suggests dose-response may differ by sex for some body-composition endpoints. Lower-dose weekly rapamycin appeared to improve selected health markers, and a higher weekly dose showed a stronger lean-mass signal in women in this dataset.

Just as important: the primary visceral-fat endpoint was not clearly improved, which keeps interpretation grounded.

## Why This Matters

Rapamycin discussions often assume one standard "anti-aging dose." These findings push against that assumption and support more personalized, clinician-led protocols with biomarker follow-up rather than fixed community dosing.

For people considering mTOR-pathway interventions, this is a reminder that efficacy and tolerability can diverge across subgroups.

## Practical Interpretation

Rapamycin remains a high-supervision intervention, not a consumer supplement. For most users, baseline longevity return still comes from foundational interventions first. If mTOR modulation is explored, it should be in a structured plan with monitoring and clear stop rules.

## Evidence Limits and What We Still Need

Current evidence is still limited by sample size, endpoint selection, and relatively short observation windows for aging outcomes. We need larger randomized cohorts with longer safety tracking, clearer sex-stratified analyses, and replication across independent centers before broad protocol claims are justified.
