# Rapamycin in Older Adults: PEARL Trial Findings on Dose, Sex Differences, and Body Composition

The PEARL trial (NCT04488601) was a randomized placebo-controlled trial testing low-dose weekly rapamycin (5 mg and 10 mg) in healthy older adults. The trial's primary endpoint — reduction in visceral adipose tissue — was not met at either dose. Secondary analyses found lean tissue changes at the 10 mg weekly dose in women, but these findings are hypothesis-generating and require replication in appropriately powered trials. Rapamycin is an FDA-approved immunosuppressive drug; its off-label use in healthy adults carries meaningful risks that must be weighed against uncertain benefits.

## Background: Rapamycin and Aging Biology

Rapamycin (sirolimus) is an mTOR inhibitor originally developed as an immunosuppressant for organ transplant recipients. The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is a central integrator of nutrient, energy, and growth factor signals. mTOR hyperactivation with aging drives cellular hypertrophy, reduced autophagy, and impaired proteostasis.

In animal models, rapamycin is one of the most reproducible lifespan-extending interventions identified. The Interventions Testing Program (ITP) extended mouse lifespan by 9–14% even when rapamycin was started at the equivalent of 60 human years. These findings motivate human testing, but mouse-to-human translation for lifespan interventions has historically been poor.

## PEARL Trial Design and Results

**Design:** Parallel-arm, placebo-controlled randomized trial in community-dwelling adults aged 50–85. Participants were randomized to 5 mg rapamycin weekly, 10 mg rapamycin weekly, or placebo. Primary endpoint: change in visceral adipose tissue volume by CT scan at 24 weeks.

**Primary outcome:** Neither 5 mg nor 10 mg weekly rapamycin produced a statistically significant reduction in visceral adipose tissue volume versus placebo. The trial did not meet its primary endpoint.

**Secondary outcomes:** In women receiving 10 mg weekly rapamycin, lean tissue mass by DEXA scan showed a statistically significant increase versus placebo. This sex-differentiated secondary outcome was not observed in men at either dose. Secondary findings should be interpreted cautiously — they were not the pre-specified primary endpoint and the trial was not powered for sex-stratified subgroup analyses.

**Tolerability:** The 5 mg and 10 mg weekly doses were generally well-tolerated in this healthy older adult population. Adverse events were reported but were described as manageable.

## Risks and Safety Context — Critical

Rapamycin is an immunosuppressive drug with a well-characterized risk profile from its approved transplant use:

- **Immunosuppression:** Even low doses impair immune surveillance. Risk of infections, including opportunistic infections, is increased.
- **Metabolic effects:** Rapamycin can worsen insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and glucose tolerance.
- **Wound healing impairment:** Clinically relevant for surgical procedures.
- **Drug interactions:** Metabolized via CYP3A4; significant interactions with many common medications including antifungals, macrolide antibiotics, calcium channel blockers.
- **Pulmonary toxicity:** Pneumonitis has been reported at higher doses.

Off-label rapamycin use in healthy adults for longevity purposes carries these risks without established clinical benefit. Medical supervision with periodic blood monitoring (rapamycin levels, CBC, metabolic panel) is essential if used outside trial settings.

## What Remains Uncertain

The primary endpoint failure in PEARL means visceral fat reduction — a metabolically and cardiovascularly relevant outcome — was not demonstrated at these doses in this population. The lean tissue secondary finding in women is biologically interesting but unconfirmed. Optimal dose, schedule, and population for any rapamycin longevity benefit in humans are unknown. Long-term safety at doses and durations relevant to anti-aging use (years, not months) has not been studied.
