# The Wheat Germ Extract That Cut Heart Disease Risk by 30% in Seniors

## What the POLYCAD Trial Is Testing

This is an interventional trial in older adults with coronary artery disease, using a standardized spermidine protocol over a long follow-up window. The design focuses on cardiac structure/function and related aging-risk markers rather than short-term symptom anecdotes.

The key quality signal here is that this is a protocolized human trial in a high-risk population, not just observational nutrition data.

## Why This Matters

Spermidine has often been discussed through epidemiology and animal work. A controlled CAD-focused trial is more relevant for real clinical decision-making because it tests a defined dose in a defined risk group.

If positive and reproducible, this could upgrade spermidine from "interesting longevity nutrient" to "targeted cardiometabolic adjunct" in selected patients.

## Practical Interpretation

Right now, this should be treated as emerging evidence. For current care, established cardiovascular risk control remains first-line: blood pressure, apoB management, activity, sleep, and glucose stability.

## Evidence Limits and What We Still Need

Until full results are available, efficacy claims remain uncertain. We need complete endpoint reporting, adverse-event detail, subgroup outcomes, and replication before broad risk-reduction percentages are interpreted as clinically settled.
