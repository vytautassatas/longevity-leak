# Vestibular Dysfunction and Dizziness Risk: Rehabilitation and Fall-Risk Protection

For [Vestibular Dysfunction and Dizziness Risk](/conditions/vestibular-dysfunction-and-dizziness-risk), the primary goal is **reduce dizziness burden and improve gait confidence**. The strongest evidence still favors consistent first-line interventions over isolated supplement strategies.

## What is known

Vestibular physical therapy has strong evidence for reducing dizziness burden and improving balance confidence in peripheral vestibular hypofunction.

Current evidence supports prioritizing a structured plan around:
1. vestibular rehabilitation
2. fall-prevention strength work
3. vision and hearing review


## Supplement context

No supplement has strong condition-specific evidence to replace first-line management in this risk profile. When used, adjuncts should be conservative and individualized.

## Monitoring priorities

Use repeat measurements and trend interpretation rather than one-off snapshots. Practical markers include:
- dizziness severity
- fall incidents
- gait confidence
- vestibular symptom triggers

## Limits and uncertainty

Evidence can be heterogeneous across populations, and some outcomes remain uncertain outside tightly defined cohorts. In many cases, effect sizes are limited unless adherence to core interventions is high. Risk context, comorbidities, and medication interactions should be considered before extending protocols.

## Practical summary

- Keep core behavior and medical interventions as the foundation.
- Use adjuncts only when they align with mechanism, safety, and monitoring capacity.
- Reassess with objective trends, not short-term symptom impressions.
