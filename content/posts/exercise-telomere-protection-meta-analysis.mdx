# 16 Weeks of Jogging Stopped Your Cells From Aging (Meta-Analysis)

## Key Findings

- Exercise maintained telomere length (SMD = 0.59)
- Aerobic exercise most effective for telomerase activity
- Minimum 16 weeks needed for significant effects
- Greater benefits observed in females


## Study Overview
