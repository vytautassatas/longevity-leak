# Reactive Hypoglycemia and Energy Crashes: Fiber Sequencing and Acarbose Context

For [Reactive Hypoglycemia and Energy Crash Risk](/conditions/reactive-hypoglycemia-and-energy-crash-risk), meal sequencing and glycemic-load control are still the first intervention layer.

## Adjunct options with plausible utility

- [Psyllium Husk](/supplements/psyllium-husk) can reduce post-meal glycemic excursion in some protocols.
- [Acarbose](/supplements/acarbose) has strong postprandial glucose evidence under clinician supervision.
- [Chromium Picolinate](/supplements/chromium-picolinate) may provide modest insulin-marker support in selected higher-risk groups.
- [Myo-Inositol](/supplements/myo-inositol) can help glucose-endocrine regulation in specific phenotypes.

## Practical protocol context

A practical sequence is:
1. Protein-fiber preloading and carbohydrate redistribution.
2. Walking after meals.
3. Adjuncts added one at a time with symptom and glucose tracking.

For broader metabolic overlap, see [Postprandial Glucose Spikes](/conditions/postprandial-glucose-spikes).

## Limits and uncertainty

Not all post-meal crashes are true hypoglycemia. Overdiagnosis based on symptoms alone is common. Supplements can mask patterns without fixing meal composition errors.

## Practical summary

- Nutrition structure is the main driver of improvement.
- Acarbose has stronger mechanistic and clinical signal than most OTC options.
- Chromium and myo-inositol are context dependent and should be monitored.
