# Chronic Low Back Pain Load: Curcumin, Boswellia, Ginger, and Collagen as Adjuncts

For [Chronic Low Back Pain Load](/conditions/chronic-low-back-pain-load), graded movement progression and functional confidence are the primary interventions.

## Adjuncts with possible support

- [Curcumin](/supplements/curcumin)
- [Boswellia Serrata](/supplements/boswellia-serrata)
- [Ginger Extract](/supplements/ginger-extract)
- [Collagen Peptides](/supplements/collagen-peptides)

These may reduce symptom burden in selected people, but they do not replace strength/mobility restoration.

## Clinical context

Most durable improvements come from restoring load tolerance, reducing movement avoidance, and supporting sleep/recovery consistency.

For joint-overlap context, review [Joint Stiffness and Mobility Loss](/conditions/joint-stiffness-and-mobility-loss).

## Limits and uncertainty

Supplement response is heterogeneous and often modest, and evidence remains limited for durable standalone effects without progressive loading. Chronic back pain outcomes are strongly influenced by psychosocial load, adherence, and movement exposure quality.

## Practical summary

- Movement restoration remains first-line.
- Anti-inflammatory adjuncts can be considered for symptom support.
- Protocols should prioritize function over short-term pain-only endpoints.
