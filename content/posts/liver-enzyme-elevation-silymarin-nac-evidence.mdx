# Liver Enzyme Elevation Risk: Silymarin, NAC, and Berberine With Lifestyle First

For [Liver Enzyme Elevation Risk](/conditions/liver-enzyme-elevation-risk), sustained energy balance, activity, glucose control, and alcohol reduction remain primary. Supplement interventions should be considered adjuncts to this base.

## Adjunct options with clinical signal

- [Milk Thistle (Silymarin)](/supplements/milk-thistle-silymarin) may improve ALT/AST in selected cohorts.
- [N-Acetylcysteine (NAC)](/supplements/n-acetylcysteine) supports glutathione pathways and may improve oxidative-stress burden.
- [Berberine](/supplements/berberine) can improve metabolic drivers that often accompany hepatic stress.

## Practical protocol context

Most useful use-case is combined treatment where metabolic pressure is actively addressed.

This often includes overlap management with [Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Risk](/conditions/non-alcoholic-fatty-liver-risk), plus ongoing ALT/AST and waist/glucose monitoring.

## Limits and safety constraints

Trial heterogeneity is high, endpoints are not always harmonized, and enzyme changes do not always translate directly to long-term fibrosis outcomes. Drug-supplement interactions are possible, especially in polypharmacy contexts.

For these reasons, supplements should be monitored and not treated as stand-alone liver therapy.

## Practical summary

- Lifestyle and metabolic correction remain first-line.
- Silymarin, NAC, and berberine can be evidence-aligned adjuncts.
- Longitudinal biomarkers and medication review are necessary.
