# Low Grip Strength Risk: Creatine, Protein, EAA, and HMB in a Strength-First Strategy

For [Low Grip Strength Risk](/conditions/low-grip-strength-risk), structured resistance training is still the leading intervention. Supplement use should reinforce training adaptation, not replace it.

## Adjuncts with practical value

- [Creatine Monohydrate](/supplements/creatine-monohydrate)
- [Whey Protein Isolate](/supplements/whey-protein-isolate)
- [Essential Amino Acids](/supplements/essential-amino-acids)
- [HMB](/supplements/hmb)

These are most helpful where baseline strength, protein intake, or recovery capacity is low.

## Implementation framework

Track handgrip trend every 4-8 weeks and pair it with chair-rise and gait-speed checks. This reduces overreliance on one metric and improves protocol decisions.

For broader power outcomes, see [Low Muscle Power Risk](/conditions/low-muscle-power-risk).

## Limits and uncertainty

Grip improvements depend heavily on program quality and adherence. Supplement effect size is variable and usually modest without progressive loading.

## Practical summary

- Training quality drives outcomes.
- Protein adequacy and creatine are common first-line adjuncts.
- EAA/HMB can be useful in selected lower-intake or higher-risk groups.
