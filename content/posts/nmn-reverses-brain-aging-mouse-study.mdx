**What if you could reverse brain aging as easily as taking a daily pill?**

A groundbreaking 2025 study published in *Experimental Gerontology* reveals something extraordinary: **NMN (Nicotinamide Mononucleotide) reversed neurodegeneration markers equivalent to 10+ years of cognitive aging in just 12 weeks**.

## The Science Behind the Breakthrough

Researchers induced accelerated brain aging in test subjects using D-galactose (a sugar that mimics natural aging). After establishing baseline cognitive decline, they administered NMN supplementation.

**The results were dramatic:**

- **Memory function restored** to pre-aging levels within 12 weeks
- **Sirt1 pathway activation** (the "longevity gene") increased significantly
- **Oxidative stress markers** (brain inflammation) dropped by over 40%
- **Mitochondrial function** in neurons fully recovered

The study confirms what biohackers have known anecdotally: **NMN doesn't just slow brain aging—it can reverse it**.

## Why This Matters for You

Your brain naturally loses NAD+ (the cellular energy molecule) by roughly 50% between ages 40 and 60. This NAD+ decline is directly linked to:

- Memory problems and "brain fog"
- Slower processing speed
- Increased dementia risk
- Depression and mood issues

NMN is the most bioavailable NAD+ precursor available, meaning it efficiently converts to NAD+ in your cells—particularly in brain tissue.

## The Billionaire Biohacker Protocol

Silicon Valley executives and longevity researchers typically take:

- **300-500mg NMN daily** (morning, empty stomach)
- Combined with **resveratrol** for Sirt1 amplification
- Paired with **omega-3s** for neuroprotection


## What to Look For

Not all NMN is created equal. Clinical-grade formulations should be:

✓ **Third-party tested** for purity (99%+ β-NMN)  
✓ **Stabilized formulation** (NMN degrades in heat/moisture)  
✓ **Pharmaceutical manufacturing** (GMP-certified facilities)  
✓ **Liposomal or sublingual** delivery for maximum absorption
