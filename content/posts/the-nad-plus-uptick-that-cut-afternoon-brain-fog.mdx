The productivity crash around 3 PM is not always a willpower problem. Sometimes it is bioenergetics. NAD+ is the coenzyme behind mitochondrial output, DNA repair, and cellular stress response. When levels drop with age, your brain often feels it first.

In early human supplementation work, nicotinamide-based NAD+ precursor strategies improved blood NAD+ availability and metabolic markers linked to cognitive resilience. The reason this matters for operators is simple: stable cellular energy means fewer attention dips and less mental drag across long work blocks.

No, this is not a license to skip sleep. But when your baseline is already disciplined, NAD+ support can function like infrastructure, not caffeine theater.
