# Low Cardiorespiratory Fitness: Evidence on Nitrate, Citrulline, and Beta-Alanine Support

Low cardiorespiratory fitness is one of the strongest modifiable risk factors in longevity medicine. The core lever is still structured training progression, not supplements. Still, targeted adjuncts can improve training quality in some people when dosing and protocol design are consistent.

Use this together with the condition framework for [Low Cardiorespiratory Fitness](/conditions/low-cardiorespiratory-fitness).

## What is known with reasonable confidence

**Dietary nitrate (beetroot)** has consistent evidence for modest improvements in exercise economy and blood-pressure-related vascular response, especially in less-trained adults.  
**Citrulline malate** can support nitric-oxide signaling and reduce perceived exertion in some protocols, though results vary by dose and training status.  
**Beta-alanine** has stronger evidence in higher-intensity efforts by improving intramuscular buffering capacity, but benefit is context dependent.

## Practical protocol context

Most useful implementation is additive, not substitutive:
1. Establish aerobic base and progressive load first.
2. Add one adjunct at a time.
3. Track objective outcomes (pace, heart-rate response, repeatability), not just subjective “energy.”

This approach reduces noise and helps identify who is a responder. It also lowers the chance of overinterpreting short-term placebo effects.

## Limits and uncertainty

Heterogeneity across trials is significant. Dose form, baseline fitness, and endpoint selection differ widely. Some protocols show clear improvements, while others show little beyond training effects alone.

Because of this, these supplements should be framed as possible training amplifiers with modest effect sizes, not as standalone solutions to low fitness risk.

## Practical summary

- Training progression remains the dominant intervention.
- Nitrate and citrulline can support vascular/exercise efficiency in selected users.
- Beta-alanine is most relevant for high-intensity tolerance rather than broad endurance gains.
- Objective monitoring is required before claiming protocol benefit.
