# Why Silicon Valley Stopped Taking Nicotinamide (And Switched to This)

## What the Head-to-Head Trial Found

In a direct short-term comparison, NMN and NR produced stronger sustained NAD-related blood signals than plain nicotinamide. Nicotinamide showed a faster but less durable pattern in this study design.

The data also supported a gut-microbiome contribution to how these compounds are converted and circulated, which helps explain why people can respond differently at similar doses.

## Why This Matters

For protocol design, this is useful because it compares precursor behavior in the same experimental context rather than across unrelated studies.

It does not prove downstream longevity outcomes. It mainly improves decision quality for selecting a precursor when the goal is raising NAD-pathway biomarkers with predictable kinetics.

## Practical Interpretation

If the objective is NAD support, the current evidence favors [NMN](/supplements/nmn) or [Nicotinamide Riboside (NR)](/supplements/nr) over standard nicotinamide for many users. Choice between NMN and NR should still be individualized by tolerance, cost, and biomarker follow-up.

Use-case framing matters:

- biomarker-oriented protocol: NMN or NR usually preferred
- conservative low-cost baseline: nicotinamide can still be reasonable
- long-term stack planning: evaluate risk, sleep, and metabolic context first

## Evidence Limits and What We Still Need

This evidence remains limited by short duration and surrogate endpoints. We still need longer randomized trials that measure functional outcomes, durability, and long-term safety across age bands and metabolic profiles. "Higher NAD" is not automatically equal to better clinical outcomes.
