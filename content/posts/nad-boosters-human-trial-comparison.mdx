# NMN and NR Double NAD+ Levels While Nicotinamide Falls Short

## Key Findings

- NMN and NR increased NAD+ by 130-150% after 14 days
- Nicotinamide showed only transient 4-hour effects
- Gut bacteria convert precursors to nicotinic acid
- Both enhanced gut health markers


## Study Overview

Recent research from Nature Metabolism, Nestlé Health Science has revealed important insights into longevity and healthy aging. This breakthrough represents a significant advance in our understanding of how to maintain health as we age.
