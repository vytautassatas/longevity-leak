# Why Silicon Valley Stopped Taking Nicotinamide (And Switched to This)

## Key Findings

- NMN and NR increased NAD+ by 130-150% after 14 days
- Nicotinamide showed only transient 4-hour effects
- Gut bacteria convert precursors to nicotinic acid
- Both enhanced gut health markers

**[STRONG EVIDENCE]**

## How It Works: The Molecular Mechanism

NAD+ (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) is essential for cellular energy production via the electron transport chain and serves as a substrate for sirtuins, PARPs (DNA repair enzymes), and CD38 (immune regulator) [1]. NMN (nicotinamide mononucleotide) converts to NAD+ via NMNAT enzymes, while NR (nicotinamide riboside) converts via NRK1/2 kinases. Both bypass the rate-limiting NAMPT enzyme in the salvage pathway [2]. NAD+ levels decline 50% from age 40-60, impairing mitochondrial function and DNA repair capacity.

## What the Research Doesn't Tell Us

Despite strong evidence for NAD+ elevation:

- **Long-term outcomes**: No trials exceed 1 year - we lack data on sustained use benefits
- **Optimal precursor**: NMN vs NR debate continues - both work, but individual response varies [1]
- **Dosing precision**: Studies use 250-1000mg/day, but optimal dose by age/health status unknown
- **Tissue distribution**: Blood NAD+ rises, but brain and muscle NAD+ changes less clear [2]
- **CD38 expression**: High CD38 (inflammation marker) may blunt NAD+ increases - no personalized protocols yet

The evidence for NAD+ elevation is strong; evidence for downstream health outcomes (longevity, disease prevention) is still emerging.

## Maximizing Absorption

**NMN vs NR considerations**:
- **NMN**: Absorbed intact through gut transporter (Slc12a8), converts to NAD+ in cells
- **NR**: Absorbed as NR, phosphorylated by NRK enzymes to NMN, then to NAD+
- **Both work**: Choose based on tolerance and cost [1]

**Optimization strategies**:
- **Timing**: Morning on empty stomach (30 min before food) for peak absorption
- **Sublingual NMN**: May bypass gut metabolism (emerging research, not definitive)
- **Avoid heat**: NMN and NR are heat-sensitive - store in cool, dark place
- **Consistency**: Daily dosing maintains elevated NAD+ levels

**Dosing**: Studies show benefits at 250-1000mg/day. Start at 250mg, increase based on response [2].

## Safety Considerations

**Drug Interactions**:
- Minimal known interactions (NAD+ is endogenous molecule)
- Theoretical concern with medications affecting methylation pathways

**Contraindications**:
- Pregnancy/breastfeeding: No safety data - avoid
- Active cancer: NAD+ supports rapid cell division - discuss with oncologist before use

**Side Effects** (uncommon, usually mild):
- Flushing, mild nausea (especially at high doses)
- Insomnia if taken late in day (cellular energy activation)
- Rare: Skin rash, headache

**Long-term safety**: Human trials up to 1 year show excellent tolerability. NR has Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) status from FDA. NMN lacks formal approval but shows similar safety profile [3].

**Who should consider**: Individuals over 40 (when NAD+ decline accelerates), those with metabolic concerns, or high oxidative stress.
