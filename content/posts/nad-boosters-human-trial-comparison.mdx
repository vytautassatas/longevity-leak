# NMN vs NR vs Nicotinamide: First Direct Human Comparison of NAD+ Precursors

A 2025 crossover trial published in *Nature Metabolism* (Nestle Health Science collaboration) is the first study to directly compare the three major NAD+ precursors — nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), nicotinamide riboside (NR), and nicotinamide (Nam) — head-to-head in healthy human adults. The key finding: NMN and NR produced sustained blood NAD+ increases of approximately 130–150% sustained over 14 days; nicotinamide produced only a transient 4-hour NAD+ elevation before returning to baseline. Gut microbiome conversion of precursors to nicotinic acid was identified as a significant metabolic pathway, raising questions about which tissue compartments are actually being supplemented.

## Study Design

The trial used a crossover design: each participant received each of the three supplements in randomized sequence with washout periods between arms. This controls for individual variation and allows within-person comparisons — a methodological strength. The dose and duration for each supplement arm were calibrated to published effective ranges. Blood NAD+ was the primary outcome; urinary metabolomics and gut microbiome composition were secondary endpoints.

Note: this trial was partly supported by Nestle Health Science, which has commercial interest in NAD+ precursor products. Industry funding is an acknowledged limitation in interpreting the results.

## Key Findings

**NMN (nicotinamide mononucleotide):** Blood whole-blood NAD+ increased approximately 130–150% above baseline within 2 weeks of supplementation and was sustained throughout the treatment period. NMN also showed positive effects on gut microbiome diversity markers.

**NR (nicotinamide riboside):** Similar sustained NAD+ elevation to NMN (~130–150%), with comparable gut microbiome effects. NMN and NR were not statistically different from each other in blood NAD+ elevation.

**Nicotinamide (niacinamide/Nam):** Produced a transient NAD+ spike peaking around 4 hours post-dose but returned to near-baseline by 24 hours. The transient nature limits its utility for sustained NAD+ support.

**Gut conversion pathway:** A substantial proportion of all three precursors was converted by gut bacteria to nicotinic acid (NA) before absorption, which then enters the Preiss-Handler NAD+ synthesis pathway. This microbiome-dependent conversion step varies between individuals and raises the question of whether circulating blood NAD+ accurately reflects tissue NAD+ levels in the brain, muscle, or liver — which cannot be measured non-invasively in clinical trials.

## What Remains Uncertain

Blood NAD+ is a surrogate marker. Whether the 130–150% increase in blood NAD+ translates to meaningful NAD+ elevation in metabolically relevant tissues — particularly skeletal muscle, liver, and brain — is not directly measurable in human clinical settings.

No functional or clinical endpoints (cognitive performance, physical capacity, disease outcomes) were primary endpoints of this comparison trial. Whether the pharmacokinetic difference between NMN/NR and nicotinamide translates to meaningful health outcomes remains unresolved.

Individual variation in gut microbiome composition creates significant inter-individual variability in how these precursors are processed. This likely contributes to the heterogeneity in NAD+ response seen across published studies.

Long-term safety data for high-dose NAD+ precursor supplementation is limited. Nicotinamide at high doses has been associated with hepatotoxicity in some contexts.

## Protocol Context

The trial used doses within published clinical ranges (typically 250–500 mg NMN/NR daily). These doses are bioavailable and well-tolerated based on published safety data. The optimal dose for specific health outcomes, rather than blood NAD+ elevation, has not been established.

For metabolic and cognitive applications, NMN and NR appear pharmacokinetically superior to nicotinamide based on sustained NAD+ elevation. Whether this pharmacokinetic advantage produces clinical benefit is a separate and unresolved question.
