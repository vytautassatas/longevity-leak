# High Sodium / Low Potassium Pattern: Dietary Correction With BP-Focused Adjuncts

For [High Sodium / Low Potassium Pattern](/conditions/high-sodium-low-potassium-pattern), the biggest gains come from whole-food dietary correction, not supplement substitution.

## Adjuncts that may fit selected cases

- [Potassium Citrate](/supplements/potassium-citrate) can support potassium and acid-base context in clinician-guided protocols.
- [Beetroot Nitrate](/supplements/beetroot-nitrate) may improve vascular function and modestly support blood-pressure response.
- [Aged Garlic Extract](/supplements/aged-garlic-extract) has modest randomized evidence for blood-pressure improvement in selected populations.

## Protocol context

Prioritize:
1. Processed-food displacement.
2. Daily potassium-rich whole foods.
3. Sodium intake reduction and blood-pressure tracking.

Adjuncts should be layered only after consistent adherence.

For shared vascular endpoints, review [Arterial Stiffness Risk](/conditions/arterial-stiffness-risk).

## Limits and uncertainty

Supplements cannot compensate for high sodium intake patterns. Potassium-focused interventions also need medication and renal-function awareness.

## Practical summary

- Food-pattern correction is non-negotiable.
- Adjuncts can provide incremental benefit.
- Monitoring and medication context are essential for safety.
