# Dasatinib and Quercetin for Senolytic Therapy: Mayo Clinic Phase 2 Trial Findings

Senolytic therapy aims to selectively eliminate senescent cells — cells that have permanently exited the cell cycle but remain metabolically active and secrete pro-inflammatory factors (the senescence-associated secretory phenotype, or SASP). The dasatinib and quercetin combination (D+Q) was identified by Mayo Clinic researchers as the first senolytic drug combination with human evidence. A Phase 2 trial in older women with low bone mineral density found improvements in bone formation markers following intermittent D+Q dosing.

## Background: Senescent Cells and Aging

Senescent cells accumulate with age in multiple tissues and secrete cytokines, proteases, and growth factors that drive local and systemic inflammation. In bone, senescent osteocytes and marrow adipoprogenitors suppress osteoblast activity and accelerate osteoclast-mediated bone resorption, contributing to age-related bone loss and fracture risk. Removing these cells in mouse models has reproducibly improved bone density, muscle function, and physical performance.

## Study Overview

Farr et al. (2017, *EBioMedicine*, PMID 29144284) established the initial human translational evidence: intermittent D+Q (100 mg dasatinib + 1,000 mg quercetin for 3 consecutive days, repeated monthly) reduced senescent cell burden in adipose tissue in a small cohort. A subsequent Mayo Clinic Phase 2 trial (Khosla et al.) enrolled 60 postmenopausal women aged 65–80 with low bone density and elevated senescent cell burden at baseline. Participants received D+Q on this intermittent schedule. Bone formation markers (P1NP) improved versus controls, and bone resorption markers were reduced. The trial used a surrogate bone biomarker endpoint rather than fracture incidence as the primary outcome.

## Mechanisms

**Dasatinib:** A BCR-ABL and Src tyrosine kinase inhibitor approved for chronic myeloid leukemia. Its senolytic activity is mediated by inhibiting pro-survival pathways (specifically BCR-ABL, Src family kinases, and PDGFR) that senescent cells depend on more than normal cells.

**Quercetin:** A flavonoid that inhibits PI3K/AKT signaling, another pro-survival pathway upregulated in senescent cells. Quercetin also inhibits the enzyme sulfotransferases that break down dasatinib and resveratrol, potentially increasing their bioavailability.

**Intermittent dosing rationale:** Senolytic effects are achieved acutely. The 3-day pulse followed by a drug-free period allows normal cells to recover while senescent cells — which have reduced DNA repair capacity — are preferentially eliminated.

## What Remains Uncertain

The trial used surrogate biomarker endpoints (bone formation markers), not fracture reduction or meaningful functional outcomes. Sample size was small. Long-term effects of repeated senolytic cycles, including effects on immune surveillance and tissue homeostasis, are unknown. Whether benefits observed in older women with low bone density generalize to other populations or conditions is not established. Independent replication outside Mayo Clinic teams is limited.

## Safety and Risk — Critical Context

**Dasatinib is an FDA-approved oncology drug with significant risks:**

- Pleural and pericardial effusion (fluid accumulation around lungs and heart)
- QT interval prolongation and cardiac arrhythmia risk
- Hepatotoxicity (liver toxicity)
- Drug interactions with CYP3A4 inhibitors/inducers (including common antifungals and some antibiotics)
- Hemorrhage risk, particularly in patients on anticoagulants

Use of dasatinib outside oncology settings is off-label and should only occur under direct physician supervision with appropriate cardiac and hepatic monitoring. The D+Q senolytic protocol should not be self-administered based on research publications.

**Quercetin at 1,000 mg/day** is generally well-tolerated but may interact with warfarin and some chemotherapy agents.

## Protocol Context (Research Summary Only)

Trials have used dasatinib 100 mg + quercetin 1,000 mg for 3 consecutive days per 4-week cycle. This intermittent schedule is distinct from the continuous daily dosing used in oncology. Biomarker monitoring (complete blood count, liver function, cardiac assessment) was performed throughout the trial. This information is provided as a research summary — clinical application requires physician evaluation and monitoring.
