# Chronic Allergic Inflammation Load: Quercetin and Vitamin C in a Trigger-Control Plan

For [Chronic Allergic Inflammation Load](/conditions/chronic-allergic-inflammation-load), the primary interventions are still trigger control, airway care adherence, and sleep protection.

## Adjuncts with possible benefit

- [Quercetin](/supplements/quercetin) has anti-inflammatory pathway rationale with modest human symptom evidence in selected groups.
- [Vitamin C](/supplements/vitamin-c) may support oxidative and immune context, especially where intake is low.

## Protocol context

Use adjuncts only after environmental and behavioral foundation is in place:
1. Allergen exposure reduction plan.
2. Guideline-aligned airway management.
3. Symptom and sleep-disruption tracking.

For immune-overlap context, review [Immune Resilience Gap](/conditions/immune-resilience-gap).

## Limits and uncertainty

Supplement effects are heterogeneous and typically modest. In persistent disease, delaying validated airway therapy in favor of supplement-first strategies increases risk of ongoing symptom burden.

## Practical summary

- Trigger control and airway care remain first-line.
- Quercetin/vitamin C are optional adjuncts.
- Measure benefit using symptom frequency and sleep impact.
