# What Silicon Valley Executives Take 90 Minutes Before Board Meetings

**There's a reason venture capitalists and Fortune 500 CEOs keep Lion's Mane in their desk drawers.**

A 2024 study published in *Nutrients* revealed something remarkable: **Lion's Mane mushroom extract produces measurable cognitive improvements within 90 minutes of ingestion**—faster than almost any other natural nootropic.

This explains why it's become the secret weapon of executives before high-stakes presentations, negotiations, and decision-making sessions.

## The Acute Cognitive Boost

Researchers at the University of Queensland gave subjects a single dose of Lion's Mane extract and measured cognitive performance at 30, 60, and 90-minute intervals.

**Results:**
- **Processing speed increased 12%** at 60 minutes
- **Working memory improved 15%** at 90 minutes
- **Stress response dampened** (cortisol levels 18% lower)
- **Peak performance window:** 60-120 minutes post-dose

This isn't placebo. Brain imaging (fMRI) showed **increased blood flow to the prefrontal cortex**—the region responsible for executive function, decision-making, and focus.

## Why Lion's Mane Works

Lion's Mane contains **hericenones and erinacines**—compounds that:

1. **Stimulate Nerve Growth Factor (NGF)** production
2. **Cross the blood-brain barrier** rapidly
3. **Promote neurogenesis** (new brain cell formation)
4. **Reduce neuroinflammation** linked to brain fog

Unlike caffeine (which peaks at 45 minutes then crashes), Lion's Mane provides **sustained cognitive enhancement for 3-4 hours** without jitters or energy collapse.

## The Executive Protocol

High-performers use this timing:

- **90 minutes before peak performance window** (meetings, presentations, deep work)
- **1,000-3,000mg extract** (standardized to 30%+ polysaccharides)
- **With coffee or L-theanine** for synergistic focus
- **Empty stomach** for fastest absorption

Many pair it with **low-dose nicotine gum** or **alpha-GPC** for amplified acetylcholine response.

## Long-Term Brain Protection

The acute benefits are impressive, but **long-term Lion's Mane use offers neuroprotection**:

- **Reduces Alzheimer's risk markers** (beta-amyloid plaques)
- **Improves memory consolidation** over 16+ weeks
- **Supports myelin sheath repair** (nerve insulation)
- **Reduces anxiety and depression** in clinical trials

A 2023 Japanese trial showed **significant cognitive improvement in aging adults** after just 12 weeks of daily Lion's Mane supplementation.

## What to Look For

Not all Lion's Mane supplements work. Clinical-grade formulations should have:

✓ **Dual-extract** (water + alcohol) for full spectrum compounds  
✓ **30%+ polysaccharides** standardized  
✓ **Fruiting body extract** (NOT mycelium on grain)  
✓ **1,000mg+ per serving** (matches research doses)  
✓ **Third-party tested** for heavy metals
