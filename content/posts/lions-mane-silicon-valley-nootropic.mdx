# Lion's Mane and Cognitive Function: Mechanisms, Human Evidence, and Protocol

Lion's Mane (*Hericium erinaceus*) is a culinary and medicinal mushroom containing bioactive compounds — hericenones and erinacines — that stimulate nerve growth factor (NGF) synthesis in vitro and in animal models. Two small randomized controlled trials in older adults with mild cognitive impairment have shown improvements in cognitive function scores versus placebo, though effects were not sustained after discontinuation. Human evidence remains limited by small sample sizes and short follow-up.

## Mechanisms

**NGF Stimulation:** Hericenones (from the fruiting body) and erinacines (from the mycelium) promote NGF synthesis in neuronal cells. NGF supports the survival, maintenance, and differentiation of neurons, particularly in the hippocampus and basal forebrain — regions central to memory formation.

**Neuroinflammation:** Lion's Mane extracts have demonstrated anti-inflammatory effects in preclinical models, inhibiting NF-κB signaling and reducing pro-inflammatory cytokines. Whether this translates to clinically meaningful anti-neuroinflammatory effects in humans is not established.

**Myelination:** Some preclinical data suggest erinacines may support myelin sheath integrity. Human evidence for this effect does not exist.

## Human Trial Evidence

**Mori et al. (2009):** The primary randomized controlled trial enrolled 30 adults aged 50–80 with mild cognitive impairment. Participants received 3,000 mg/day of dried Lion's Mane mushroom powder (fruiting body) for 16 weeks. The Lion's Mane group showed statistically significant improvements on the Revised Hasegawa Dementia Scale versus placebo. Notably, cognitive scores declined toward baseline four weeks after supplementation stopped, suggesting the benefit was not durable post-discontinuation.

**Saitsu et al. (2019):** A second trial (n=31, older adults without formal MCI diagnosis) found improvements in the Kana Pick-Out Test (a cognitive screening tool) after 12 weeks of 3 g/day Lion's Mane powder supplementation. This was a secondary analysis with exploratory endpoints.

Both trials used dried mushroom powder, not concentrated extracts. Effect sizes were modest, populations were older adults with some cognitive vulnerability, and neither trial was large enough to generalize broadly.

## What Remains Uncertain

- The optimal form (fruiting body vs. mycelium; powder vs. extract), dose, and duration are not established in humans
- Benefits have not been replicated in cognitively healthy younger adults in adequately powered trials
- The clinical significance of improvements on screening scales used in these trials is debated
- Long-term safety data and durability of effects beyond the trial period are unknown
- Industry funding is present in some Lion's Mane research; independent replication is limited

## Protocol Context

The Mori 2009 trial used 3,000 mg/day of dried fruiting body powder. Concentrated extracts are commonly standardized to beta-glucan content, but no human dose-ranging studies have been published. Timing relative to performance tasks has not been studied in adequately controlled human trials.

Lion's Mane is generally considered well-tolerated. Reported adverse effects are rare and typically mild (GI discomfort). Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported. Individuals with mushroom allergies should use caution.
