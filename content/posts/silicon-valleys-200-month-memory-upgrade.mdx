# Resveratrol and Memory Retention: Evidence from a 26-Week Randomized Trial in Older Adults

Resveratrol, a stilbene polyphenol found in grape skin and red wine, has been studied for cognitive effects in older adults based on its activity as a SIRT1 activator and its effects on vascular function and glucose metabolism. Witte et al. (2014), published in *Journal of Neuroscience*, conducted a 26-week randomized controlled trial in 46 healthy older adults and found statistically significant improvement in memory retention in the resveratrol group versus placebo, alongside improvements in hippocampal functional connectivity and glucose metabolism. The study is one of the strongest human trials for resveratrol in cognition, but sample size limits generalizability.

## Study Overview

**Design:** Double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial. Participants were healthy adults aged 50–75 without cognitive impairment at enrollment.

**Intervention:** 200 mg/day resveratrol (plus 20 mg piperine for absorption enhancement) for 26 weeks.

**Primary outcomes:**
- Memory retention: Resveratrol group showed statistically significant improvement on a word-list retention task (p = 0.038)
- Hippocampal functional connectivity: Increased in the resveratrol group by fMRI
- Glucose metabolism: HbA1c and fasting glucose improved in the resveratrol group

**Sample:** n=46 (23 per group). This is a small trial; statistically significant results in small samples carry higher risk of being chance findings or being sensitive to individual outliers.

## Mechanisms

**SIRT1 activation:** Resveratrol acts as an allosteric activator of SIRT1 (Sirtuin-1), a NAD+-dependent deacetylase involved in energy sensing, vascular function, and stress resistance. SIRT1 activation promotes mitochondrial biogenesis and may protect neurons from oxidative damage.

**Vascular and endothelial effects:** Resveratrol improves endothelial function by increasing nitric oxide bioavailability, which promotes cerebral blood flow. Improved blood flow to the hippocampus may directly support memory consolidation.

**Glucose metabolism:** Improved insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism reduce the metabolic burden on neurons and may reduce the vascular risk factors that accelerate cognitive aging.

**Quercetin co-administration:** Quercetin inhibits sulfotransferases that metabolize resveratrol, increasing its bioavailability. Piperine (black pepper extract) similarly enhances resveratrol absorption — used in the Witte trial at 20 mg/day.

## What Remains Uncertain

The Witte 2014 trial enrolled 46 participants — too small to draw definitive conclusions. Effect sizes should be interpreted with this limitation in mind. Whether findings replicate in larger, independently funded trials has not been fully demonstrated. The study enrolled cognitively healthy adults; applicability to individuals with MCI or early Alzheimer's pathology is not established. Resveratrol has low bioavailability from standard formulations; variability in absorption between individuals and formulations is significant.

Resveratrol at high doses (>1 g/day) may interact with anticoagulants and CYP450 enzymes. The 200 mg dose used in the trial is considered modest and well-tolerated.

## Protocol Context

The Witte 2014 trial: 200 mg/day resveratrol + 20 mg piperine, orally, for 26 weeks. Fat co-administration improves resveratrol absorption. Quercetin is commonly co-formulated based on pharmacokinetic rationale. This represents the best-characterized dose-duration combination for cognition in humans; whether higher doses produce greater benefit is not established in controlled trials.
