# Vitamin D Deficiency and Immune Function: Prevalence, Evidence, and Supplementation Protocol

Vitamin D deficiency is common across many populations and is linked to immune dysregulation risk. The strongest intervention evidence comes from randomized trials showing that supplementation can reduce acute respiratory infection risk in selected groups, with the clearest benefit in people who are deficient at baseline.

## Evidence Summary

A major BMJ meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials found an overall reduction in acute respiratory infection risk with vitamin D supplementation. Benefit was not uniform across all groups and was more consistent in deficiency contexts.

Clinical interpretation:

- deficiency correction has the strongest evidence base,
- effect size is meaningful but not a substitute for comprehensive infection prevention,
- outcomes vary by baseline status, dose schedule, and adherence.

## Why Baseline Status Matters

Vitamin D biology affects innate and adaptive immune signaling. When baseline levels are low, repletion may improve immune resilience markers and reduce infection susceptibility in some settings. In already sufficient populations, incremental benefit is less predictable.

## Dosing and Monitoring Context

Dosing strategy should be individualized by baseline blood level and follow-up testing. Daily regimens are commonly used in clinical practice; very high-dose unsupervised protocols increase safety risk without reliable added benefit.

Practical monitoring includes:

- serum 25-OH vitamin D,
- calcium-related safety context,
- reassessment after dose adjustments.

The goal is correction of deficiency and maintenance in a safe range, not aggressive maximization.

## Safety and Cautions

Vitamin D is generally safe within guideline-aligned ranges, but high-dose use can cause harm in susceptible individuals.

Risks include:

- hypercalcemia with excessive intake,
- interactions in people with specific kidney/parathyroid disorders,
- overconfidence from supplementation without addressing broader risk factors.

## Practical Positioning

Vitamin D should be treated as a foundational deficiency-correction tool, especially in low-status individuals, rather than a universal high-dose longevity intervention.

## Evidence Limits and What We Still Need

Open questions include optimal target ranges for different populations, dosing schedules by phenotype, and long-term outcome relevance beyond infection endpoints. Higher-target strategies used in some longevity practices remain more weakly supported than deficiency correction itself.
