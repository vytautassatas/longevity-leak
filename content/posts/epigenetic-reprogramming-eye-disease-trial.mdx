# Partial Epigenetic Reprogramming for Vision Loss: Life Biosciences ER-100 Trial

Life Biosciences received FDA clearance of an Investigational New Drug (IND) application to begin a first-in-human clinical trial of ER-100, a partial epigenetic reprogramming therapy for vision loss conditions including glaucoma and non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION). IND clearance means the FDA has reviewed safety data and authorized the trial to proceed — it is not the same as drug approval, and no human efficacy data yet exists. The trial represents the first test of Yamanaka factor-based epigenetic reprogramming in humans.

## Background: Epigenetic Reprogramming

The Yamanaka factors (Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, c-Myc — collectively OSKM) can reprogram adult somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Lu et al. (2020, *Nature*) demonstrated that partial, transient expression of three factors (OSK — without c-Myc, which carries oncogenic risk) in aged mouse retinal ganglion cells restored youthful DNA methylation patterns, improved retinal function, and regenerated damaged optic nerves after injury — without inducing pluripotency or tumor formation.

The mechanism proposed is that aging involves progressive drift in epigenetic marks (particularly DNA methylation patterns) away from a "youthful" set point. OSK expression may reset these patterns, restoring youthful gene expression without altering the underlying DNA sequence.

## ER-100 Trial Design

ER-100 delivers OSK factors via adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors, injected intraocularly. The trial targets patients with glaucoma-related optic nerve damage and NAION, conditions with limited treatment options. Enrollment criteria, primary endpoints, and expected duration have not been fully disclosed at the time of IND clearance.

This is a Phase 1/2 safety and preliminary efficacy trial — the primary question is whether the therapy is safe in humans, not whether it improves vision at a population level.

## Primate Evidence

Non-human primate studies showed that AAV-OSK delivery to the retina increased axon regeneration after optic nerve crush injury and partially restored vision function as measured by electrophysiological and behavioral tests. Primate studies are a meaningful step beyond rodent models in assessing safety and tolerability of AAV delivery approaches.

## What Remains Uncertain

This is frontier science at the earliest human testing stage. Key unknowns include:

- Whether the epigenetic reset observed in mice translates to humans at clinically meaningful scale
- Long-term safety of sustained OSK expression in human tissue (including oncogenic risk with prolonged Yamanaka factor activity)
- Whether intraocular delivery generalizes to other tissue targets
- Efficacy in humans with established optic nerve damage remains completely unknown until trial data matures
- Regulatory path to approval would require Phase 3 efficacy data, years beyond current stage

The gap between a cleared IND and a proven therapy is large. Most IND-cleared therapies do not reach approval.

## Why This Is Scientifically Significant

Even at the IND stage, ER-100 represents a conceptual milestone: the first attempt to test whether the epigenetic aging clock can be partially reset in living human tissue. The outcome — positive or negative — will meaningfully inform the broader reprogramming field. Negative safety results would constrain the approach; positive efficacy signals would open a new category of regenerative medicine.
