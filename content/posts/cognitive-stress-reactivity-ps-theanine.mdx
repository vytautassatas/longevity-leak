# Cognitive Stress Reactivity Load: Evidence on Theanine, Phosphatidylserine, and Recovery Anchors

For [Cognitive Stress Reactivity Load](/conditions/cognitive-stress-reactivity-load), the highest-yield interventions are still sleep stability, workload pacing, and stress-skill practice. Supplements should be treated as secondary supports.

## Adjuncts with plausible benefit

- [L-Theanine](/supplements/l-theanine) can reduce perceived stress and improve calm-focus in some protocols.
- [Phosphatidylserine](/supplements/phosphatidylserine) has mixed but relevant data for stress reactivity and cognition under load.
- [Magnesium Glycinate](/supplements/magnesium-glycinate) may improve recovery and sleep-related contributors to stress reactivity.
- [Ashwagandha](/supplements/ashwagandha) shows small-to-moderate stress score improvements in several randomized studies.

## Practical protocol framing

A practical sequence is:
1. Stabilize sleep/wake timing and high-demand work blocks.
2. Track focus volatility and perceived stress weekly.
3. Add one adjunct at a time for 2-4 weeks.

For autonomic overlap, review [Low HRV Recovery Strain](/conditions/low-hrv-recovery-strain).

## Limits and uncertainty

Most studies use short durations and subjective stress scales. Benefits can be real but modest, and overstacking calming compounds can increase sedation or reduce daytime sharpness.

## Practical summary

- Behavior design and recovery rhythm remain core.
- Supplement effects are typically additive, not transformative.
- Sequential testing with basic tracking improves signal quality.
