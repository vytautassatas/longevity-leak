# CoQ10 for Blood Pressure and Vascular Function: What Meta-Analyses Show

Coenzyme Q10 has moved beyond "energy support" marketing into a clearer cardiometabolic role. A 2022 systematic review and meta-analysis reported statistically significant blood-pressure reductions in adults receiving CoQ10, though effect sizes were modest and not uniform across populations. The practical takeaway is not medication replacement. It is potential add-on support in selected patients with elevated pressure and broader vascular risk.

## What the current evidence supports

Across pooled human data, CoQ10 appears to lower systolic and diastolic blood pressure by small-to-moderate amounts in many cohorts, with stronger signals in people who start with higher baseline pressure. Earlier meta-analytic work reached a similar direction of effect, which improves confidence that the signal is not from one isolated trial.

This is most useful when interpreted as risk-layering. If someone already has a structured blood-pressure plan, CoQ10 may offer incremental support rather than a standalone fix. See the full profile for [CoQ10](/supplements/coq10), and use it inside a broader [Hypertension](/conditions/hypertension) strategy.

## Protocol context, not promise language

Most studies use roughly 100-300 mg/day, usually with meals that include fat to support absorption. Ubiquinol may be preferred in older adults because conversion efficiency can decline with age, but head-to-head superiority remains context dependent.

Monitoring still matters. Home BP logs, resting heart rate trends, and medication review should stay central. For vascular aging context, connect this with [Endothelial Function Decline](/conditions/endothelial-function-decline).

## What remains uncertain

Not every trial shows the same magnitude of benefit. Heterogeneity in baseline risk, formulations, and study duration is substantial. Long-term event outcomes (heart attack, stroke) are also less clearly established than short-term blood-pressure changes.

That is why CoQ10 should be framed as an adjunctive option with a generally favorable safety profile, not as a substitute for evidence-based hypertension care. For broader context, see our prior review on [CoQ10 and mitochondrial function](/posts/coq10-mitochondrial-energy-aging).
