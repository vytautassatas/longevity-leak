# Creatine Plus Protein in Older Adults: Strength and Frailty-Relevant Outcomes

For aging populations, the strongest supplement evidence is not usually exotic compounds. It is foundational support for muscle retention: resistance training plus enough protein, with creatine as an add-on in many programs. Meta-analytic data in older adults show creatine can improve lean mass and strength when paired with progressive training.

## What is most likely to help

Creatine is best viewed as a training amplifier, not a passive intervention. The most consistent outcomes are gains in strength and lean mass, especially over multi-week resistance programs. In real-world longevity planning, this has direct overlap with mobility, independence, and injury resilience.

For practical dosing and safety context, use [Creatine Monohydrate](/supplements/creatine-monohydrate). Combine it with structured protein targets using [Whey Protein Isolate](/supplements/whey-protein-isolate) or [Essential Amino Acids](/supplements/essential-amino-acids) when daily intake is low.

## Condition-level relevance

This strategy aligns directly with [Sarcopenia and Frailty](/conditions/sarcopenia-and-frailty) and [Protein Intake Deficit](/conditions/protein-intake-deficit). It can also support broader fall-risk reduction when integrated with balance and strength work, as outlined in [Balance and Fall Risk](/conditions/balance-and-fall-risk).

The key is integration: training progression, protein adequacy across the day, recovery, and adherence monitoring. Supplements alone without training usually produce smaller and less durable effects.

## What remains uncertain

Not all studies show the same functional outcomes (for example gait speed or everyday activity). Baseline nutrition, comorbidity burden, and training quality influence response. Kidney disease or complex medication profiles also require clinician-guided personalization.

So the evidence is encouraging but still context-dependent. The highest-confidence claim is improved muscle-related outcomes in structured programs, not universal frailty reversal.
