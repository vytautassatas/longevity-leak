# Berberine for Fatty Liver Risk (MASLD): Human Trial and Meta-Analysis Update

Berberine has stronger evidence in glucose regulation than in liver outcomes, but newer pooled analyses suggest it may also help in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD, previously NAFLD). The direction of effect is generally favorable for liver enzymes and metabolic markers, with the largest benefits usually seen when baseline metabolic burden is higher.

## What the human evidence shows

Recent randomized-data meta-analysis indicates berberine can improve ALT, AST, and selected metabolic endpoints in MASLD populations. Individual trials have also reported improvements in hepatic-fat-related measures when berberine is paired with lifestyle intervention.

This does not mean berberine alone reverses disease. It is better framed as one component in a weight-loss and insulin-sensitivity plan. For implementation details, start with [Berberine](/supplements/berberine) and map it to [Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Risk](/conditions/non-alcoholic-fatty-liver-risk).

## Protocol context in practice

Most protocols use divided dosing with meals (often in the 900-1500 mg/day range). GI intolerance is common early and often manageable by slower titration. Drug interaction review is mandatory, especially for people on glucose-lowering therapy.

Because visceral fat is a core driver of MASLD progression, this content should be used alongside [Visceral Adiposity Risk](/conditions/visceral-adiposity-risk) and established nutrition/activity interventions.

## Limits and uncertainty

Heterogeneity remains high across studies. Formulations, background diets, and treatment duration vary, and long-term fibrosis outcomes are less certain than short-term biomarker changes. Some signals are robust for labs but still weak for hard clinical outcomes.

So the evidence supports cautious use in selected patients, with monitoring, not broad claims of "liver cure" effects. For broader glycemic context, see our earlier post on [Berberine for metabolic health](/posts/berberine-natural-ozempic-weight-loss).
