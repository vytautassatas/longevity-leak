# Polypharmacy and Interaction Risk: Medication Review and Deprescribing Priorities

For [Polypharmacy and Interaction Risk](/conditions/polypharmacy-and-interaction-risk), the primary goal is **reduce medication-related adverse effects and interaction burden**. The strongest evidence still favors consistent first-line interventions over isolated supplement strategies.

## What is known

Medication-burden review and deprescribing frameworks are central for reducing adverse events in older adults with complex regimens.

Current evidence supports prioritizing a structured plan around:
1. structured medication review
2. deprescribing where appropriate
3. interaction-aware supplement planning


## Supplement context

No supplement has strong condition-specific evidence to replace first-line management in this risk profile. When used, adjuncts should be conservative and individualized.

## Monitoring priorities

Use repeat measurements and trend interpretation rather than one-off snapshots. Practical markers include:
- medication count
- interaction alerts
- adverse event frequency
- functional status

## Limits and uncertainty

Evidence can be heterogeneous across populations, and some outcomes remain uncertain outside tightly defined cohorts. In many cases, effect sizes are limited unless adherence to core interventions is high. Risk context, comorbidities, and medication interactions should be considered before extending protocols.

## Practical summary

- Keep core behavior and medical interventions as the foundation.
- Use adjuncts only when they align with mechanism, safety, and monitoring capacity.
- Reassess with objective trends, not short-term symptom impressions.
