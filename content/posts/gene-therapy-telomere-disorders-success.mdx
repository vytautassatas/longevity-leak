# Gene Therapy for Telomere Biology Disorders: EXG-34217 Trial Results at Cincinnati Children's

Elixirgen Therapeutics' EXG-34217, a lentiviral gene therapy delivering a functional copy of the *TERT* gene (telomerase reverse transcriptase), demonstrated sustained telomere elongation and partial hematopoietic recovery in the first two patients treated at Cincinnati Children's Hospital. Both patients had dyskeratosis congenita (DC), a severe inherited bone marrow failure syndrome caused by pathogenic mutations in telomere maintenance genes. Results were published in *NEJM Evidence*. This is a treatment for a life-threatening genetic disease — not a general anti-aging intervention for healthy adults.

## What Is Dyskeratosis Congenita?

Dyskeratosis congenita is a rare inherited disorder characterized by pathologically short telomeres in hematopoietic stem cells and other rapidly dividing tissues. Mutations in genes encoding components of the telomerase complex (DKC1, TERT, TERC, RTEL1, and others) impair the cell's ability to maintain telomere length, leading to progressive bone marrow failure, pulmonary fibrosis, liver disease, and cancer predisposition. Median survival without bone marrow transplant is reduced, and allogeneic transplant carries significant morbidity and mortality in this population.

The disease is distinct from normal aging. In DC, telomeres are not just shortening due to age — they are critically short from birth due to a genetic defect in the telomere maintenance machinery.

## Study Overview

The trial enrolled two pediatric and young adult patients with genetically confirmed DC and severe aplastic anemia. EXG-34217 was administered as a single intravenous infusion after mild conditioning. Follow-up extended to 24–25 months. Outcomes included:

- Sustained increases in leukocyte telomere length in both patients
- Hematopoietic recovery (improved blood counts, reduced transfusion dependence)
- No serious adverse events attributed to the gene therapy at the reported follow-up duration
- No requirement for standard immunosuppressive conditioning regimens used in allogeneic transplant

## Mechanism

EXG-34217 uses a lentiviral vector to deliver a codon-optimized TERT gene into hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells ex vivo. Corrected cells are then reinfused. TERT is the catalytic subunit of telomerase; restoring its expression in cells that lack functional TERT allows telomere maintenance to resume. This is a direct genetic correction of the molecular defect rather than a symptomatic treatment.

## What This Does and Does Not Mean

**What it shows:** A targeted gene therapy can restore telomerase function and rescue hematopoietic cells in patients with a specific genetic telomere disorder. This is a meaningful advance for an underserved rare disease population with limited treatment options.

**What it does not show:** This is not evidence that telomere lengthening extends lifespan or improves health in people without telomere biology disorders. The biology of DC — catastrophically short telomeres due to gene mutation — differs fundamentally from the gradual, heterogeneous telomere attrition seen in normal aging. Extrapolating from DC treatment to general anti-aging applications would require entirely separate evidence.

## What Remains Uncertain

- Two patients is a very small sample; longer follow-up and larger cohorts are needed to assess durability and safety
- Whether the hematopoietic recovery translates to reduction in the non-hematological manifestations of DC (pulmonary, hepatic, malignancy) requires years of monitoring
- Insertional oncogenesis risk from lentiviral vectors (a known concern with retroviral gene therapies) requires extended safety surveillance
- Generalizability to all DC genotypes and disease severities is unknown
