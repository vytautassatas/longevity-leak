# Post-Viral Fatigue Risk: Pacing, Sleep Restoration, and Recovery Capacity

For [Post-Viral Fatigue Risk](/conditions/post-viral-fatigue-risk), the primary goal is **restore capacity after infection-associated energy decline**. The strongest evidence still favors consistent first-line interventions over isolated supplement strategies.

## What is known

Use pacing and gradual activity return to rebuild capacity while reducing the risk of post-exertional crashes.

Current evidence supports prioritizing a structured plan around:
1. graded activity pacing
2. sleep recovery
3. micronutrient repletion


## Supplement context

These adjuncts may be considered in selected profiles, with conservative dosing and monitoring:
- [CoQ10 (Ubiquinol)](/supplements/coq10)
- [Acetyl-L-Carnitine (ALCAR)](/supplements/acetyl-l-carnitine)
- [Rhodiola Rosea](/supplements/rhodiola-rosea)

Supplement use should remain secondary to the core intervention strategy and clinical follow-up.

## Monitoring priorities

Use repeat measurements and trend interpretation rather than one-off snapshots. Practical markers include:
- fatigue scores
- activity tolerance
- sleep continuity
- resting heart rate

## Limits and uncertainty

Evidence can be heterogeneous across populations, and some outcomes remain uncertain outside tightly defined cohorts. In many cases, effect sizes are limited unless adherence to core interventions is high. Risk context, comorbidities, and medication interactions should be considered before extending protocols.

## Practical summary

- Keep core behavior and medical interventions as the foundation.
- Use adjuncts only when they align with mechanism, safety, and monitoring capacity.
- Reassess with objective trends, not short-term symptom impressions.
