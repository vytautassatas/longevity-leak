# Magnesium L-Threonate and Brain Health: Evidence from Human Trials

Magnesium L-threonate (MgT) is a form of magnesium developed specifically for its ability to raise brain magnesium levels. In rodent studies, MgT increased cerebrospinal fluid magnesium more effectively than magnesium chloride and was associated with improvements in synaptic density and memory performance. Human trials are limited in number and size, but have shown modest cognitive improvements in older adults with subjective cognitive complaints.

## Mechanisms

**NMDA Receptor Function:** Magnesium is a physiological blocker of NMDA receptors at resting membrane potential. Adequate brain magnesium may support synaptic plasticity by regulating the threshold for long-term potentiation — the cellular correlate of learning and memory.

**Synaptic Density:** Preclinical data from Slutsky et al. (2010) showed that elevating brain magnesium through MgT increased hippocampal synaptic density in aged rats. Whether this structural effect occurs in humans has not been directly measured.

**Blood-Brain Barrier Penetration:** The threonate ligand is proposed to facilitate transport across the blood-brain barrier via a transporter-mediated mechanism. This pharmacokinetic advantage over other magnesium forms has been demonstrated in animal models; human cerebrospinal fluid data are not available.

## Human Trial Evidence

**Wang et al. (2024):** A randomized controlled trial (PMID 39252819) enrolled 109 older adults (mean age ~57) with self-reported cognitive complaints. Participants received 1,500–2,000 mg MgT daily (providing ~144 mg elemental magnesium) or placebo for 12 weeks. The MgT group showed statistically significant improvements in overall composite cognitive scores versus placebo, with effects most pronounced on executive function and working memory subdomains. The study was conducted in China; sponsor involvement was noted.

**Liu et al. (2016):** An earlier open-label pilot (PMID 26519483) in adults with mild cognitive impairment found improvements on cognitive assessments after 12 weeks of MgT supplementation. The absence of a placebo control limits interpretation.

Effect sizes in both studies were modest. Trials enrolled older adults with cognitive complaints rather than healthy younger populations. Independent replication without industry involvement has not been published.

## What Remains Uncertain

- Whether cognitive benefits generalize to adults without subjective cognitive complaints or to younger populations
- The direct human evidence for blood-brain barrier penetration over other magnesium forms (all existing data is preclinical)
- Long-term effects and durability beyond 12 weeks of study
- Optimal dose and formulation for different clinical populations
- Industry funding was present in primary trials; independent replication is needed

## Who Should Use Caution

Magnesium supplementation at supplemental doses is generally well-tolerated. Individuals with impaired kidney function should consult a physician before use, as impaired renal magnesium clearance increases risk of hypermagnesemia. MgT may interact with certain antibiotics (quinolones, tetracyclines) and bisphosphonates by reducing their absorption; spacing doses by 2+ hours is typically recommended.

## Protocol Context

The Wang 2024 trial used 1,500–2,000 mg MgT daily (split between morning and evening doses). This is the best-characterized human dosing protocol. Other magnesium forms (glycinate, citrate, oxide) differ in bioavailability and clinical applications; none have the same body of brain-specific research.

Total elemental magnesium contribution from MgT at clinical doses (~144 mg) is modest relative to dietary reference intakes (310–420 mg/day for adults) and should be considered alongside dietary magnesium intake.
