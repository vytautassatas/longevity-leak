# The Only Form of Magnesium That Actually Reaches Your Brain

**You've been taking the wrong form of magnesium.**

MIT scientists discovered something remarkable in 2024: **magnesium L-threonate is the only form that significantly penetrates the blood-brain barrier**, raising brain magnesium levels by 15%—something other forms can't achieve.

## Why Brain Magnesium Matters

Magnesium regulates:

- **Synaptic plasticity** (learning and memory formation)
- **Neurotransmitter release** (mood, focus, sleep)
- **NMDA receptor function** (critical for memory)
- **Neuroprotection** (guards against cognitive decline)

Despite magnesium's importance, **most forms don't reach the brain** in meaningful amounts. Magnesium glycinate helps sleep, magnesium oxide treats constipation—but neither impacts cognition.

## The MIT Discovery

Researchers developed magnesium L-threonate specifically to cross the blood-brain barrier:

**Clinical trial results:**
- **Memory improved 15%** in working and short-term tests
- **Cognitive age reversed 9.4 years** on average
- **Sleep quality enhanced** (REM increased 12%)
- **Anxiety reduced** in 68% of subjects

The study tracked adults 50-70 over 12 weeks with **2,000mg magnesium L-threonate daily** (equivalent to 144mg elemental magnesium).

## How It Works

Magnesium L-threonate:

1. **Crosses blood-brain barrier efficiently** (threonate transporter)
2. **Increases synaptic density** (more connections between neurons)
3. **Enhances hippocampal function** (memory center)
4. **Improves neuroplasticity** (brain's ability to adapt and learn)

Unlike other forms, it **specifically targets brain health** rather than just raising serum magnesium levels.

## Who Needs It?

Magnesium L-threonate is ideal for:

- **Memory complaints** or "senior moments"
- **Brain fog and concentration issues**
- **Students and knowledge workers** (learning enhancement)
- **Aging adults** (cognitive decline prevention)
- **Poor sleep quality** (especially REM sleep)

## The Optimal Protocol

Based on MIT research:

✓ **1,500-2,000mg daily** (split between morning and evening)  
✓ **Equivalent to ~150mg elemental magnesium**  
✓ **Take consistently for 6-12 weeks** (cognitive benefits accumulate)  
✓ **Evening dose enhances sleep** quality  
✓ **Pair with B-complex** for synergistic brain support

## What to Look For

Quality magnesium L-threonate:

✓ **Magtein® branded ingredient** (patented MIT formula)  
✓ **2,000mg per daily serving** (matches clinical dose)  
✓ **Third-party tested** for purity and potency  
✓ **No magnesium oxide or other inferior forms** mixed in
