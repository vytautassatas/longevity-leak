# Orthostatic Intolerance Risk: Hydration Strategy, Conditioning, and Safety Checks

For [Orthostatic Intolerance Risk](/conditions/orthostatic-intolerance-risk), the primary goal is **improve positional tolerance and reduce dizziness-related events**. The strongest evidence still favors consistent first-line interventions over isolated supplement strategies.

## What is known

Orthostatic symptom control typically needs fluid-salt strategy, medication review, compression and conditioning tactics, and clinician-guided autonomic evaluation when dizziness, tachycardia, or presyncope persists.

Current evidence supports prioritizing a structured plan around:
1. hydration and sodium strategy
2. graded conditioning
3. medication review for hypotensive effects


## Supplement context

These adjuncts may be considered in selected profiles, with conservative dosing and monitoring:
- [Potassium Citrate](/supplements/potassium-citrate)

Supplement use should remain secondary to the core intervention strategy and clinical follow-up.

## Monitoring priorities

Use repeat measurements and trend interpretation rather than one-off snapshots. Practical markers include:
- supine-standing blood pressure
- dizziness episodes
- hydration consistency
- activity tolerance

## Limits and uncertainty

Evidence can be heterogeneous across populations, and some outcomes remain uncertain outside tightly defined cohorts. In many cases, effect sizes are limited unless adherence to core interventions is high. Risk context, comorbidities, and medication interactions should be considered before extending protocols.

## Practical summary

- Keep core behavior and medical interventions as the foundation.
- Use adjuncts only when they align with mechanism, safety, and monitoring capacity.
- Reassess with objective trends, not short-term symptom impressions.
