# Low Muscle Power Risk: Creatine, Protein, EAA, and HMB With Power Training

For [Low Muscle Power Risk](/conditions/low-muscle-power-risk), the highest-yield intervention is power-oriented resistance programming. Supplement support is additive only when training quality and protein adequacy are already in place.

## Adjuncts with practical relevance

- [Creatine Monohydrate](/supplements/creatine-monohydrate)
- [Whey Protein Isolate](/supplements/whey-protein-isolate)
- [Essential Amino Acids](/supplements/essential-amino-acids)
- [HMB](/supplements/hmb)

These have the strongest use-case in older or deconditioned adults with low baseline power and insufficient protein intake.

## Protocol context

A practical sequence:
1. Build a supervised power-focused training plan.
2. Ensure daily protein targets are met.
3. Add one adjunct at a time and monitor function.

For broader frailty overlap, also review [Sarcopenia and Frailty](/conditions/sarcopenia-and-frailty).

## Limits and uncertainty

Supplement effects differ by baseline nutrition, training intensity, and age. Without progressive loading, expected benefit is small.

## Practical summary

- Training prescription is the core intervention.
- Protein strategy and creatine are usually first adjuncts.
- EAA/HMB are context-dependent add-ons for selected users.
