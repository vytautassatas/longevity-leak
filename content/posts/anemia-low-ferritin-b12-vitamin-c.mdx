# Anemia and Low Ferritin Risk: B12, Vitamin C, and Lab-First Repletion

For [Anemia and Low Ferritin Risk](/conditions/anemia-and-low-ferritin-risk), the core intervention is still cause-first diagnosis plus iron repletion when indicated. Supplement stacks should not replace diagnostic clarity.

## What is reasonably supported

- Iron-deficiency anemia improves with protocolized repletion and follow-up labs.
- [Vitamin B12](/supplements/vitamin-b12) is high-value in confirmed deficiency states and can prevent persistent neurologic or hematologic complications.
- [Vitamin C](/supplements/vitamin-c) can support deficiency correction and may improve non-heme iron absorption in some dietary patterns.

## Practical clinical context

Most errors come from treating fatigue alone rather than confirming the anemia subtype. Ferritin, transferrin saturation, and hemoglobin trend should drive decisions.

When ferritin is low, repletion strategy should be paired with root-cause review (blood loss, absorption, dietary patterns, inflammatory confounding).

For overlap with energy complaints, see [Mitochondrial Fatigue](/conditions/mitochondrial-fatigue).

## Limits and uncertainty

B12 and vitamin C are supportive, not substitutes for iron therapy when iron deficiency is the primary mechanism. Some users also misread ferritin without inflammatory context, which can delay effective treatment.

## Practical summary

- Confirm cause before building a supplement plan.
- Use B12 when deficiency risk is documented or strongly suspected.
- Use vitamin C as adjunctive support, not standalone anemia treatment.
- Reassess with repeat labs rather than symptom-only tracking.
