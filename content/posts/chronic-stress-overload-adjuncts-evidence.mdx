# Chronic Stress Overload: Evidence for Theanine, Ashwagandha, Magnesium, and Phosphatidylserine

For [Chronic Stress Overload](/conditions/chronic-stress-overload), structured sleep/wake anchors, movement, and stress-skills training produce the most consistent outcomes. Supplements may help symptoms, but effect sizes are usually modest.

## Adjuncts with signal

- [L-Theanine](/supplements/l-theanine) can reduce perceived stress and improve calm-focus in selected settings.
- [Ashwagandha](/supplements/ashwagandha) has randomized-trial signal for stress and anxiety score reduction.
- [Magnesium Glycinate](/supplements/magnesium-glycinate) may improve sleep quality and tension symptoms, especially in people with low intake.
- [Phosphatidylserine](/supplements/phosphatidylserine) has mixed but plausible evidence for stress-reactivity and cognitive-load support.

## Practical implementation

Use one change at a time for 2-4 weeks and track:
- sleep regularity,
- resting heart rate,
- subjective stress burden,
- daytime cognitive stability.

For autonomic overlap, see [Low HRV Recovery Strain](/conditions/low-hrv-recovery-strain).

## Limits and risk framing

Most trials are short and heterogeneous, and outcomes are often self-reported. Overstacking multiple calming compounds can increase sedation or blur cause-and-effect.

These compounds should be treated as optional support around behavior, not a substitute for workload, sleep, and recovery redesign.

## Practical summary

- Behavioral foundations drive most benefit.
- Supplements can help symptom load, but usually with small-to-moderate effect sizes.
- Sequential testing with simple monitoring improves decision quality.
