# Osteopenia and Fragility: Protein, Vitamin D3, and K2 in a Training-First Plan

For [Osteopenia and Fragility](/conditions/osteopenia-and-fragility), the dominant lever is still progressive loading plus fall-risk reduction. Supplements are secondary and should be framed as adjuncts to a structured plan, not replacements for training and clinical follow-up.

## What is reasonably supported

- [Vitamin D3](/supplements/vitamin-d3) is useful when deficiency is present and helps support bone-mineral metabolism.
- [Vitamin K2](/supplements/vitamin-k2) can improve vitamin K status biomarkers and may support calcium handling in bone-focused protocols.
- [Whey Protein Isolate](/supplements/whey-protein-isolate) helps meet daily protein targets that support musculoskeletal adaptation.
- [Creatine Monohydrate](/supplements/creatine-monohydrate) has strong evidence for strength and lean-mass support when paired with resistance training.

## Practical protocol context

The most defensible sequence is:
1. Establish resistance and impact-loading consistency.
2. Correct low vitamin D status and total protein deficits.
3. Add adjuncts only when adherence to training and nutrition is stable.

For fracture prevention, also review [Balance and Fall Risk](/conditions/balance-and-fall-risk).

## Limits and uncertainty

Hard fracture endpoints are harder to improve than short-term biomarkers. Some trials show better surrogate markers without clear near-term fracture reduction. Response also differs by age, baseline bone status, hormone context, and medication history.

This is why DEXA trend, functional strength, and fall exposure matter more than single-marker interpretation.

## Practical summary

- Training load progression remains central.
- Protein adequacy and deficiency correction are high-yield fundamentals.
- D3/K2 and creatine are best used as targeted adjuncts.
- Monitoring should stay longitudinal, not snapshot-based.
