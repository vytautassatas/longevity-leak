# Vitamin D3 and Telomere Attrition: Findings from the VITAL Randomized Trial

The VITAL (VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL) study was a large randomized controlled trial (n=25,871) testing 2,000 IU/day vitamin D3 and 1 g/day omega-3 fatty acids for cardiovascular disease and cancer prevention. A nested sub-study measured leukocyte telomere length in a subset of 1,054 participants over 4 years. The vitamin D3 group showed approximately 140 base pair reduction in telomere attrition versus placebo — equivalent to roughly 3 years of typical biological aging protection. The omega-3 arm showed no significant effect on telomere length. Telomere length is a surrogate marker; whether this telomere finding translates to reduced disease incidence or extended healthspan requires direct evidence.

## Background: Telomeres and Aging

Telomeres are repetitive DNA sequences (TTAGGG) capping chromosome ends, maintained by the enzyme telomerase. With each cell division, telomeres shorten due to incomplete replication of lagging strands. When telomeres reach critically short lengths, cells undergo replicative senescence or apoptosis. Shorter telomere length in leukocytes is associated epidemiologically with higher risk of cardiovascular disease, certain cancers, and all-cause mortality in observational studies.

Whether telomere length is a mechanistic driver of these outcomes or a downstream marker of cellular stress and aging is debated. Interventions that slow telomere attrition may or may not produce meaningful changes in health outcomes.

## Study Overview

**Population:** 1,054 participants drawn from the VITAL trial biorepository, selected for baseline blood samples (2011–2013) with 4-year follow-up samples

**Intervention:** 2,000 IU/day vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) vs. placebo; 1 g/day omega-3 (EPA+DHA) vs. placebo — 2x2 factorial design

**Primary measurement:** Leukocyte telomere length by quantitative PCR at baseline and 4 years

**Vitamin D3 result:** The vitamin D3 group lost approximately 140 fewer base pairs of telomere length over 4 years compared to placebo. This was statistically significant. By reference to population aging rates of approximately 40–45 base pairs per year, 140 bp corresponds to roughly 3 years of telomere aging protection.

**Omega-3 result:** No statistically significant difference in telomere attrition between omega-3 and placebo groups. This negative finding is important — it means that not all anti-inflammatory interventions affect telomere biology equivalently.

## Mechanism: Why Vitamin D May Affect Telomeres

Vitamin D receptor (VDR) activation has been shown to:
- Reduce oxidative stress, a primary driver of accelerated telomere attrition
- Decrease inflammatory cytokine production (IL-6, TNF-alpha), which promotes telomere-shortening replication cycles in immune cells
- Upregulate telomerase activity in some cell types in vitro

Whether these mechanisms are sufficient to produce the telomere preservation observed at 2,000 IU/day in the VITAL sub-study is biologically plausible but not mechanistically confirmed in the trial itself.

## What Remains Uncertain

**Surrogate endpoint caveat:** Leukocyte telomere length is a surrogate biomarker. The VITAL main trial showed no reduction in cardiovascular events and only modest cancer outcomes at 2,000 IU/day — which means the relationship between vitamin D supplementation, telomere length, and clinical disease outcomes is not linear or directly established.

**Population:** VITAL enrolled predominantly adults aged 50+ without major vitamin D deficiency at baseline. Effects may differ in vitamin D-deficient populations (where immune-mediated telomere attrition could be more pronounced) or in younger adults.

**Measurement:** Leukocyte telomere length by PCR has significant measurement variability. The 140 bp signal, while statistically significant, is modest relative to inter-individual variation in telomere length.

**Omega-3 null result:** The null finding for omega-3 suggests the telomere benefit is not simply anti-inflammatory — there may be more specific vitamin D receptor-mediated mechanisms involved.

## Protocol Context

The VITAL trial used 2,000 IU/day vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol), taken as a daily supplement. Optimal vitamin D status for telomere effects (and health outcomes more broadly) is debated; most guidelines recommend target serum 25(OH)D levels of 40–60 ng/mL. Individuals with baseline vitamin D deficiency (&lt;20 ng/mL) may show more pronounced responses to supplementation across multiple endpoints.
