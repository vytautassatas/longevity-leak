# The Vitamin That Reversed 3 Years of Cellular Aging (VITAL Trial)

## What the VITAL Substudy Reported

In a large, long-duration context, daily vitamin D3 supplementation was associated with slower telomere attrition versus placebo in a substudy cohort. The signal is notable because few nutrient interventions have multi-year cellular-aging biomarker data at this scale.

At the same time, this is a biomarker finding, not direct proof of lifespan extension.

## Why This Matters

Vitamin D already has strong evidence for deficiency correction and immune-bone health support. A potential telomere-preservation signal adds biologic plausibility for broader healthy-aging relevance, especially in populations with low baseline status.

But translation should stay conservative: correcting deficiency is high-confidence care; "anti-aging reversal" claims are much lower confidence.

## Practical Interpretation

For most adults, the highest-value strategy is still lab-guided correction and maintenance, not aggressive mega-dosing.

- check baseline 25(OH)D
- dose to a target range with follow-up labs
- pair with broader risk-control foundations

## Evidence Limits and What We Still Need

The evidence remains limited by endpoint type and subgroup interpretation. We still need replication, clearer effect-modifier analysis (baseline status, adherence, demographics), and stronger linkage between telomere changes and hard clinical outcomes.
