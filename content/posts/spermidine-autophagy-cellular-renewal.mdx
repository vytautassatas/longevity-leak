# Why Centenarians in Japan Have 10x More of This Compound

**Your cells have a built-in self-cleaning system. Spermidine turns it on.**

A 2024 study in *Nature Aging* confirmed what longevity researchers have suspected: **spermidine supplementation extends lifespan by up to 25% in human cell models**—by triggering autophagy, your body's cellular recycling process.

## What Is Autophagy?

Autophagy (Greek for "self-eating") is your cells' ability to:

- **Break down damaged proteins** and organelles
- **Recycle cellular components** for energy and repair
- **Clear toxic buildup** that causes aging
- **Prevent cancer, dementia, and metabolic disease**

As you age, autophagy declines dramatically. By age 60, your cellular cleanup runs at roughly **30% efficiency** compared to your 20s. This accumulation of "cellular junk" is one of the hallmarks of aging.

## The Spermidine Discovery

Austrian researchers followed 829 adults for 20 years, tracking diet and mortality:

**Key findings:**
- **High spermidine intake reduced all-cause mortality by 40%**
- **Cardiovascular deaths dropped 60%** in high-spermidine groups
- **Cognitive decline slowed significantly**
- **Benefits equivalent to 5-10 years younger biological age**

The optimal dose from food alone? Nearly impossible—you'd need to eat 2kg of wheat germ daily.

## How Spermidine Works

Spermidine activates autophagy through multiple pathways:

1. **Inhibits EP300** (an enzyme that blocks autophagy)
2. **Activates AMPK** (the cellular energy sensor)
3. **Mimics fasting benefits** without caloric restriction
4. **Protects mitochondria** from age-related damage

Think of it as **"fasting in a pill"**—you get the longevity benefits of intermittent fasting without the hunger or lifestyle disruption.

## The Clinical Evidence

Human trials show spermidine supplementation:

- **Improved memory** in aging adults by 15% over 12 months
- **Reduced arterial stiffness** (cardiovascular aging marker)
- **Enhanced immune function** (T-cell activity increased 30%)
- **Lowered inflammatory markers** across the board

## The Optimal Protocol

Research-backed dosing:

✓ **5-10mg spermidine daily** (matches longevity study doses)  
✓ **Morning, empty stomach** for enhanced absorption  
✓ **Combine with fasting** for synergistic autophagy  
✓ **Pair with resveratrol** for SIRT1 + autophagy activation  

## What to Look For

Clinical-grade spermidine supplements should have:

✓ **Wheat germ extract standardized** to 1%+ spermidine  
✓ **5-10mg spermidine per serving** (not just wheat germ weight)  
✓ **Polyamine profile tested** (spermidine, spermine ratios)  
✓ **Non-GMO, organic source material**
