# Post-Hospitalization Frailty Recovery Risk: Protein, Creatine, and EAA/HMB Context

For [Post-Hospitalization Frailty Recovery Risk](/conditions/post-hospitalization-frailty-recovery-risk), the major leverage points are early mobility progression and adequate daily protein intake.

## Adjuncts with clinical rationale

- [Whey Protein Isolate](/supplements/whey-protein-isolate) helps meet anabolic protein targets.
- [Creatine Monohydrate](/supplements/creatine-monohydrate) can support strength and functional recovery.
- [Essential Amino Acids](/supplements/essential-amino-acids) may support muscle retention where appetite is low.
- [HMB](/supplements/hmb) can assist lean-mass preservation in deconditioned settings.

## Practical protocol context

Most useful sequence:
1. Initiate supervised mobility and resistance progression early.
2. Establish protein targets and meal distribution.
3. Add one adjunct at a time with functional monitoring.

For broader context, see [Sarcopenia and Frailty](/conditions/sarcopenia-and-frailty).

## Limits and uncertainty

Effect sizes vary by baseline status, rehab intensity, and total protein intake. Supplements cannot compensate for inadequate mobility exposure.

## Practical summary

- Early movement and nutrition are non-negotiable.
- Creatine and protein support are often first adjuncts.
- EAA and HMB are context-dependent, especially in lower-intake or higher-frailty profiles.
